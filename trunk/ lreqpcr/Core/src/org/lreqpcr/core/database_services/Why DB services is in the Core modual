DB4O was found to function only if it is within the same package as the
data objects it stores, and thus had be placed in the Core modual.

Subsequently, the Database Services had to be also placed in the Core modual
because DatabaseServices has to import Family, which is a Core data object.
At the same time, DB4O requires importing DatabaseServices. So, placing
the Database service into its own modual causes cross dependencies, which
the NetBeans platform does not allow.

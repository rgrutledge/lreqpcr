        <h1 align="center">Replicate Profile Scattering</h1>
      	<p>As described in the Optical Precision section,
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profiles</a> 
		are constructed from the replicate profiles (if more than one is 
		available) in order to increase optical precision, which can greatly 
		improve the performance of some instruments with poor optics. </p>
		<p>However, in order to generate a valid average profile, the replicate 
		profiles must be reasonably clustered. As of version 0.9.3 the LRE 
		Analyzer monitors profile clustering and will invalid an average profile 
		if the&nbsp; <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#C1/2">C<sub>1/2</sub></a> 
		values of its replicate sample profiles differ by <font color="#FF0000">
		&gt;0.7 cycles</font>. </p>
		<p>Although an average of the target quantities generated by the 
		replicate profiles are provided in the average profile label, profile 
		scattering is generally considered to invalid the analysis unless a 
		clear reason for the scattering can be identified. </p>
		<p>Note that this issue is still under discussion, and modifications may 
		be implemented in future versions of the program. </p>

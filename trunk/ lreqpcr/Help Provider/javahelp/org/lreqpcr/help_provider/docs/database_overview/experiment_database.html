    	<p align="left">The data is organized into a tree-like structure, which 
		provides a convenient method for viewing and editing of data. This also 
		introduces the concept of an
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile</a>, 
		which is used to increase
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Read_Precision">read precision</a>. 
		Note that the average and replicate profiles are edited independently, 
		so that for example, changes to the
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#LRE_Analysis">LRE analysis</a> of a replicate profile will not change 
		analysis of the average profile. However, as described in the 
		<a href="../explorer_panel/experiment_database_window.html">Experiment 
		Database Window</a> overview, replicate profiles can be excluded from the analysis, 
		which triggers the corresponding average profile to be recalculated 
		using the remaining replicate profiles.&nbsp; </p>

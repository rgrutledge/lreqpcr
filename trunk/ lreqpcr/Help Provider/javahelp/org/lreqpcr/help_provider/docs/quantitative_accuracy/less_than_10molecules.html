        <h1 align="center">The &lt;10 Target Molecule Problem</h1>
		<p align="left">Note the data presented here was taken from:<br>
		Rutledge RG, Stewart D (2010) Assessing the performance capabilities of 
		LRE-based assays for absolute quantitative real-time PCR. PLoS ONE 5: 
		e9731. </p>
		<p><b>Scattering of replicate profiles<br>
		</b>In contrast to most samples which produce replicate profiles that are 
		highly clustered, samples containing &lt;10 target molecules can produce 
		highly scattered replicate profiles. This is an example of a low abundance transcription that produced 
		replicate profile scattered over a two cycle region, which is predicted 
		by LRE quantification to range from 1-6 molecules, with an average of 
		4.0 molecules per <font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l. :</p>
		<p align="center">
		<b>Production of highly scattered profiles at low target concentrations</b><br>
		<img border="0" src="images/fus_undiluted.gif" width="394" height="516"></p>
		<p>Although this 
		large range of predicted target quantities suggest that quantitative 
		accuracy has been compromised, Poisson distribution provides an 
		alternative explanation:</p>
		<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/poisson_distribution_graph.gif" width="532" height="372"></p>
		<p>This illustrates that at very low target quantities the frequency of 
		aliquots (Y-axis) that will contain a specific number of target 
		molecules (X-axis) can vary considerably, and that this variance is 
		dependent on the target concentration (Z-axis). Poisson distribution 
		further predicts that at target concentrations below about 0.5 molecules 
		per aliquot, the vast majority of aliquots will contain either one or 
		zero target molecules.</p>
		<p>The highly scattered FUS cDNA replicate profiles shown above are thus 
		consistent with that predicted by Poisson distribution. Diluting the 
		sample 10X (i.e. to a predicted 0.4 N/<font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l) 
		also produced replicate reactions that are consistent with that 
		predicted by Poisson distribution: </p>

		<b>Profile clustering is restored for single molecule amplifications<br>
		</b>
		<img border="0" src="images/fus_10Xdiluted.gif" width="390" height="445"></p>
		<p>Note that the four nil reactions are predicted to be a result of 0 N 
		aliquots, which in the absence of non-specific amplification products 
		will fail to produce an amplification product. Furthermore, the 
		predicted target quantity of 0.5 N/<font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l 
		(four molecules in eight aliquots = 4/8 = 0.5 per aliquot) is very close 
		to the predicted 0.4 N per aliquot shown above<font face="Times New Roman">, 
		indicating that quantitative accuracy was maintained down to a single 
		target molecule. While a detailed overview is beyond the scope of this 
		discussion, working with single molecule amplifications provides an 
		absolute landmark for real-time qPCR, in that it defines quantitative 
		scale without the need to apply an external quantitative standard. A 
		similar example is presented in the <a href="lda_overview.html">LDA 
		Overview</a>.</font></p>
		<p>The <b>&lt;10 molecule problem</b> thus consists of two phenomenon that impact 
		LRE quantification. The first is that extensive scattering of amplification profiles 
		can dramatically compromise the ability to 
		generate an accurate&nbsp;<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile</a>. 
		The second is the necessity of averaging target quantities generated by 
		individual replicate profiles in order to accurately determine target quantity. 
		Importantly,this must include zero molecule aliquots, characterized by 
		failure of an amplification reaction to generate a profile.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>When a target quantity of &lt;10 molecules is encountered, the LRE 
		Analyzer will report target quantity as an average of that derived from 
		the replicate profiles. This is indicated within the average profile 
		label by presenting the target quantity in brackets: </p>

		provides a detail discussion of Poisson distribution and how absolute 
		quantification can be conducted based on the frequency of nil reactions. </p>

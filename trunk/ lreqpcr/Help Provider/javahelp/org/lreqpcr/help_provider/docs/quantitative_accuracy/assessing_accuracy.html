        <h1 align="center">Assessing Quantitative Accuracy</h1>
		<p align="left">To provide a hands on example of how quantitative 
		accuracy can be evaluated, data has been taken from the Experiment Demo 
		Database is used to demonstrate two central aspects, which are assay 
		precision and absolute accuracy. To assess the general level of assay 
		precision, target quantities generated from the three runs for the 12240, 46630 
		and GAPDH targets within the COL 1 sample are compared:</p>

		<p align="left">The CV values provide a general indication of run to run 
		variance, producing an averages of about Â±5%. This is reflective of the 
		high level precision that can be achieved when a high performance 
		instrument (AB 7500) is combined with high performance amplicons. </p>
		<p align="left">However, this type of analysis cannot be used to assess 
		absolute accuracy. As described in the <a href="lda_overview.html">LDA Overview</a>, Poisson 
		distribution can be used to conduct absolute quantification that is 
		independent of real-time PCR by diluting the target to below one 
		molecule per reaction and conducting replicate reactions (16-32). Based on the number of nil reactions (i.e. 
		those that fail to produce an amplification profile), the target 
		quantity can be determined using the equation:</p>
		<p align="center">

		<p align="left">where &quot;#nil&quot; is the number of amplification reactions 
		that fail to produce an amplification profile (i.e. 0 N aliquots), &quot;#total&quot; is the total 
		number of replicate reactions conducted and &quot;N<sub>av</sub>&quot; is the 
		target concentration. An important qualification is that reactions that 
		produce of 
		non-specific amplification products must either be absent or can be 
		identified, as such reactions are false positives. Indeed, the GAPDH amplicon used in 
		this analysis did not fulfill this requirement, as it generated a large 
		number of small, non-specific products. While this is generally not 
		typical, it does provide an example of how LDA can also provide useful 
		insights into amplicon performance that may not be evident from testing 
		with high target quantities. </p>

		<p align="left">Although generally not required, manual adjustment of the LRE 
		window may be desirable. The LRE Plot within the
		<a href="../editor_panel/profile_editor_window.html">Profile Editor</a> 
		window provides the ability to change the size of the LRE window by clicking on the 
		radio buttons located on the left and right of the panel:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/manual_adjustment.gif" width="356" height="208"></p>
		<p align="left">Note that each time the LRE window is modified, LRE 
		analysis is repeated and all of the panels within the editor are 
		updated. Note also that these changes are automatically saved to disk. 
		The &quot;Reset&quot; button triggers an automated window selection. </p>

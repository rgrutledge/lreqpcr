		<p>LRE window selection defines the two core parameters upon which LRE 
		analysis is based, <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Emax">E<sub>max</sub></a> 
		and <font face="Arial"><a href="../glossary/glossary.html#deltaE">Î”E</a></font>. Developing an effective method that is amenable to 
		automation was thus essential for the general efficacy and reliability of the LRE 
		Analyzer. The strategy taken is to start by selecting the first cycle of the LRE window 
		(referred to as the start cycle), which defines the bottom of the LRE window. 
		The LRE window is then expanded by adding cycles to the top of the 
		window, until a cycle is encounter that exceeds a specified threshold 
		based on conformity to the <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#LRE_Model">
		LRE model</a>.</p>

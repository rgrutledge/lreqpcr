        <h1 align="center">Welcome to the LRE Analyzer</h1>
		<p>The LRE Analyzer was developed as a standalone, platform independent 
		desktop program that automates qPCR data analysis, which in combination 
		with utilizing lambda gDNA as a universal quantitative standard, allows 
		absolute quantification to be conducted with little or no user 
		intervention. Originating from modeling PCR amplification as a sigmoidal 
		process, the LRE Analyzer provides the automated analysis and data 
		storage capabilities required for large-scale projects, in addition to 
		providing quality control capabilities that are difficult, if not 
		impossible to achieve using convention qPCR methodologies. </p>
		<p>Note that the LRE qPCR website (<font color="#FF0000">sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr</font>) 
		provides additional information about LRE, including a three part video 
		describing how LRE was conceived, along with a detailed overview of 
		methods used to evaluate the accuracy and dynamic range of 
		LRE quantification.</p>

        <h1 align="center">Welcome to the LRE Analyzer Ver. 0.9</h1>
		<p>If you are unfamiliar with LRE qPCR,
		the
		<a href="lre_overview/lre_introduction.html">LRE Overview</a> section 
		provides a basic description of the underlying principles. The 
		LRE qPCR website (<font color="#FF0000">sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr</font>) 
		also 
		provides additional information about LRE, including a three part video 
		series describing how LRE was conceived, along with  
		methods that were used to evaluate the accuracy and dynamic range of 
		LRE quantification.</p>
		<p align="left">The
		<a href="program_overview/user_interface_overview.html">Program Overview</a> 
		section describes how the program is structured, which, 
		along with the <a href="getting_started/demo_databases.html">demonstration databases</a>, 
		provides a hands-on introduction to how the program functions. </p>
		<p align="left">The <a href="data_import/data_import_overview.html">
		Data Import</a> section provides instructions on how to import data 
		from various software packages, along with the ability to manually 
		import data.&nbsp; However, it is recommended that before attempting to 
		analyze your own datasets 
		<a href="getting_started/implementing_lre_assays.html">Implementing 
		LRE-based Assays</a> should be consulted.</p>
		<p align="left">The
		<a href="optical_calibration/optical_calibration_overview.html">Optical 
		Calibration</a> section describes how quantitative scale is determined, 
		based on calibrating the fluorescence intensity of an assay. This is 
		required for for each individual assay-instrument combination and 
		requires that an optical calibration factor be manually entered into the 
		experiment database window. </p>
		<p align="left">The <a href="data_export/data_export_overview.html">Data 
		Export</a> section describes how data can be exported to an Excel 
		workbook, sorted by run, sample or amplicon. </p>
		<p align="left">The <a href="quality_control/quality_control.html">
		Quality Control</a> and <a href="issues/known_issues_overview.html">
		Trouble Shooting</a> sections describe various issues related to 
		achieving and maintaining quantitative accuracy.</p>

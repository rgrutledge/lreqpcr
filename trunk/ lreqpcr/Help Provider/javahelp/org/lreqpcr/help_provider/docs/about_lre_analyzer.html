		<p>The LRE Analyzer provides the automated analysis and data storage 
		capabilities needed by large-scale qPCR projects, wanting to exploit the 
		many advantages of absolute quantification. Originating from the 
		application of sigmoidal mathematics to modeling PCR amplification, 
		linear regression of efficiency (LRE) enables large-scale absolute 
		quantification by eliminated the need for standard curves. Based on the 
		ability to derive target quantity directly from fluorescence readings 
		within the central region of an amplification profile, the LRE Analyzer 
		is able to determine the number of target molecules within a sample, 
		with little or no user intervention.</p>
		<p>Note that the LRE qPCR website (<font color="#FF0000">sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr</font>) 
		provides additional information about LRE, including a three part video 
		describing how LRE was conceived, along with a detailed overview of 
		methods that were used to evaluate the accuracy and dynamic range of 
		LRE quantification.</p>

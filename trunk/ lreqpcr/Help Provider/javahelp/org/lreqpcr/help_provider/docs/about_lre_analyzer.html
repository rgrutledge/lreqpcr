		<p>The LRE Analyzer provides the automated analysis and data storage 
		capabilities required by large-scale qPCR projects wanting to exploit the 
		many advantages of absolute quantification. Originating from modeling 
		PCR amplification as a sigmoidal process, 
		linear regression of efficiency (LRE) eliminates the need to construct standard curves 
		for conducting absolute quantification. Based on the 
		ability to determine target quantity directly from fluorescence readings 
		within the central region of an amplification profile, the LRE Analyzer 
		allows absolute quantification to be conducted with little or no user 
		intervention.</p>
		<p>Note that the LRE qPCR website (<font color="#FF0000">sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr</font>) 
		provides additional information about LRE, including a three part video 
		describing how LRE was conceived, along with a detailed overview of 
		methods used to evaluate the accuracy and dynamic range of 
		LRE quantification.</p>

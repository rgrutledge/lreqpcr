        <h1 align="center">What is the &quot;LRE Window&quot;?</h1>
		<p>The LRE window encompasses a group of contiguous cycles that are used 
		for <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#LRE_Analysis">LRE analysis</a> of 
		a profile. In the illustration below, the LRE window, depicted as 
		black circles within the <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#LRE_plot">
		LRE plot</a>, is four cycles in size and is derived from the cycles within 
		the central region of the
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Amplification_profile">amplification 
		profile</a>, depicted as red circles within the
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#FC_Plot">Fc plot</a>:</p>
		<p align="center"><map name="FPMap0">
		<area href="../glossary/glossary.html#FC_Plot" shape="rect" coords="9, 62, 105, 105">
		<area href="../glossary/glossary.html#LRE_plot" shape="rect" coords="1, 208, 119, 249">
		</map>
		<img border="0" src="images/lre_plot1.gif" width="429" height="380" usemap="#FPMap0"></p>
		<p>The LRE window can be expanded or contracted by adding or removing 
		cycles at each end of the window, which can be done manually as is 
		described in <a href="manual_window_selection.html">Manual Window Selection</a>. In the example shown below, the LRE window has been expanded to 
		6 cycles by adding a single cycle to both the bottom and top of the window:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/lre_plot3.gif" width="347" height="302"></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>This new six cycle window generates a target quantity of 77 molecules, which is similar to the 67 
		molecules generated by the four cycle window. Nevertheless, based on the 
		expectation that the quantitative precision increases as the LRE window 
		size is increased, a major objective for developing automated window 
		selection was to maximize the size of the LRE window.</p>

        <h1 align="center">An Introduction to LRE</h1>
		<p>Linear regression of efficiency (LRE) originated from recognition 
		that real-time qPCR could be greatly simplified through the application 
		of sigmoidal mathematics, which if automated, would allow absolute qPCR 
		to be conducted with little or no user intervention. </p>
		<p>Derived from on the ability to determine target quantity directly 
		from individual fluorescence readings within the central region of an 
		amplification profile, LRE provides an alternative to the relative 
		quantification upon which most current qPCR methodologies are based. A 
		key component was to adopt lambda gDNA as a universal quantitative 
		standard, which, among other capabilities, allows absolute quantification 
		to be conducted without the need to construction of target-specific standard curves. 
		The following provides a step by step overview of how LRE functions, 
		most of which is described in <a href="lre_literature.html">Rutledge and 
		Stewart (2008a)</a>.</p>
		<p>Real-time PCR was developed from the ability to monitor the increase in 
		amplicon DNA quantity using some form of 
		fluorescence chemistry. This in turn generates an&nbsp; &quot;amplification 
		profile&quot; (or profile for short) in which&nbsp; reaction fluorescence is 
		plotted against cycle number:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>The Amplification Profile</b><br>
		<img border="0" src="images/fc_plot1.gif" width="358" height="108"></p>
		<p>Each cycle is thus defined by the &quot;cycle fluorescence&quot; (F<sub>C</sub>), 
		which when using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green I, is proportional to 
		the amount amplicon DNA mass present at the end of each cycle. 
		Conventional qPCR methods determine target quantity based on the 
		relative position of the profile. A major limitation of this approach 
		(among many others) is that absolute quantification requires 
		construction of target-specific standard curves. </p>
		<p>LRE expands the capabilities of qPCR by extending data analysis 
		beyond simple determination of profile position. This was accomplished by 
		first determining the amplification efficiency produced during each 
		cycle, based on the increase in amplicon DNA mass relative to the amount 
		of amplicon DNA present at the beginning of the cycle. This of course is 
		the amount of amplicon present at the end of the previous cycle, which 
		is referred to as F<sub>C-1</sub>:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/lre_fa1.gif" width="187" height="58"></p>
		<p>The definition of a cycle can thus expanded to include its 
		amplification efficiency, referred to as &quot;cycle efficiency&quot; or E<sub>C</sub>. 
		</p>
		<p>The core functionality of LRE was derived from the ability to view PCR 
		amplification not as the increase in amplicon DNA, but rather as the 
		loss in amplification efficiency. This is done by plotting the E<sub>C</sub> 
		of each cycle against its F<sub>C</sub>, generating what is referred to 
		as the &quot;LRE Plot&quot;:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>The LRE Plot<br>
		</b><img border="0" src="images/lre_plot1.gif" width="356" height="207"></p>
		<p>This reveals a linear relationship between amplification efficiency and the 
		amount of amplicon DNA present at the end of a cycle. Although the 
		mechanism of this linear coupling is unknown, this provides the ability 
		to linearize an amplification profile, which among other attributes, 
		allows the kinetics of amplification to be quantified, using linear 
		regression analysis based on the equation:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/LRE_linear_equation.gif" width="184" height="27"></p>
		<p align="left">
		Referred to as &quot;LRE Analysis&quot;, this generates values for the two parameters 
		that govern PCR 
		amplification, which are the maximal amplification efficiency (E<sub>max</sub>) 
		determined from the Y-intercept and the rate of loss in amplification 
		efficiency (Î”E) determined from the slope. The cycles included into the 
		linear regression analysis are taken from the central region of the profile, which avoids 
		distortions caused by low reaction fluorescence in the earliest cycles, and aberrations associated with cycles within the upper 
		region. This central region is referred as the &quot;LRE 
		window&quot;, which is denoted by black and red circles within the LRE 
		and F<sub>C</sub> plots, respectively:</p>

		<p align="center"><b>The LRE Window<br>
		</b><img border="0" src="images/fc_plot2.gif" width="355" height="107"></p>
		<p align="left">Note also that the plateau phase is described by the maximal fluorescence (F<sub>max</sub>), 
		which corresponds to the X-intercept within the LRE plot, can be 
		calculated using the equation:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>X-intercept<br>

		<img border="0" src="images/Fmax_equation.gif" width="103" height="51"></p>
		<p align="left">In addition to generating a linear representation of PCR 
		amplification, a derivative of the classic Boltzmann sigmoid 
		function that has been adapted to PCR <a href="lre_literature.html">
		(Rutledge and Stewart 2008a)</a> can be used to determine target quantity can 
		be directly from a cycle&#39;s F<sub>C</sub>:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/Fo_equation.gif" width="230" height="73"></p>
		<p align="left">
		This generates the third parameter defining a cycle, which is the 
		predicted target quantity expressed in fluorescence units, which is referred 
		to as the &quot;cycle F<sub>0</sub>&quot;. Target quantity is then derived by 
		averaging the F<sub>0</sub> values from all of the cycles within the LRE 
		window, which is visual displayed in what is called the &quot;F<sub>0</sub> 
		Plot&quot;:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>The F<sub>0</sub> Plot<br>
		</b><img border="0" src="images/fo_plot.gif" width="331" height="108"></p>
		<p align="left">The fourth cycle parameter is the predicted F<sub>C</sub>, 
		(pF<sub>C</sub>) calculated using a second sigmoidal derivative:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/LRE_model.gif" width="244" height="81"></p>
		<p align="left">
		When displayed in the F<sub>C</sub> plot as circles, this allows 
		assessment of the general conformity of a profile to the LRE model:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>Adding predicted F<sub>C</sub><br>
		</b><img border="0" src="images/fc_plot3.gif" width="355" height="108"></p>
		<p align="left">Among other attributes, this can reveal aberrant 
		amplification kinetics, such as &quot;plateau drift&quot;:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>An example of modest Plateau Drift<br>
		</b><img border="0" src="images/fc_plot4.gif" width="357" height="106"></p>
		<p align="left">As described in more detail in the
		<a href="../lre_window_selection/lre_window_selection_overview.html">LRE 
		Window Selection</a> section, it is important to exclude such aberrant 
		cycles from the analysis, as they can generate quantitative errors. </p>
		<p align="left">As described in the
		<a href="../optical_calibration/optical_calibration_overview.html">
		Optical Calibration</a> overview, the final step is to convert target 
		quantity expressed in fluorescence units (i.e. the average F<sub>0</sub>) 
		into the number of target molecules, using an optical calibration factor 
		(OCF) generated by amplification of a known quantity of lambda gDNA. 
		Similar to a conventional fluorescence assay for quantifying DNA, 
		fluorescence is converted to DNA mass (M<sub>0</sub>), that is then 
		converted to the number of target molecules (N<sub>0</sub>) based on 
		amplicon size (A<sub>S</sub>):</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/fo_conversion.gif" width="325" height="59"></p>
		<p align="left">In summarize, LRE introduces a new paradigm for qPCR 
		based on deriving the target quantity directly from the&nbsp; fluorescence 
		readings within the central region of an amplification profile, in 
		addition to expanding the definition of a cycle beyond its fluorescence 
		readings (F<sub>C</sub>), to include cycle efficiency (E<sub>C</sub>), 
		predicted target quantity (F<sub>0</sub>), and predicted fluorescence 
		(pF<sub>C</sub>). In combination with adopting lambda gDNA as a 
		universal quantitative standard, the need to construct target-specific 
		standard curves is eliminated, making it possible to conduct large-scale 
		absolute quantification with few resources beyond that needed for target 
		amplification. </p>

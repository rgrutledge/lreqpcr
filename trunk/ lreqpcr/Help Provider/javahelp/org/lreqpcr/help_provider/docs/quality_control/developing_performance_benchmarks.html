        <h1 align="center">Developing Performance Benchmarks</h1>
      	<p align="left">Originating from recognition that like for other 
		molecular technologies, lambda gDNA could be used as a universal 
		standard for qPCR, lambda-based assays provided an essential foundation 
		for development and testing of LRE. This included investigations into 
		the impact of enzyme formulation, SYBR Green I concentration, reaction 
		volume, amplicon size and GC content, and cycling regime<sup><a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a></sup>. </p>
		<p align="left">The general utility of lambda-based performance benchmarks 
		became even more evident during broad implementation of LRE that 
		included, for 
		example, performance testing of a new instrument or enzyme formulation, 
		in addition to becoming a central part of the quality control protocols 
		provided by the LRE Analyzer. As discussed in the
		<a href="optical_precision_overview.html">optical precision overview</a>, 
		a prominent example are differences in optical performance as reflected 
		by scattering of the LRE plot, which 
		for the examples below were generated with 100 pg lambda gDNA + CAL1, 
		amplified with QuantiTect using an identical cycling regime (95 <sup>o</sup>C 
		10sec, 65 <sup>o</sup>C 120 sec):</p>

		<p>Particularly for cycles within the lower region of the amplification 
		plots, it is clear that the Applied Biosystems 7500 with normal ramping 
		produces the highest optical precision, as reflected by generating E<sub>C</sub> 
		values that best conform to the LRE line. </p>
		<p>Other examples include <a href="monitoring_assay_performance.html">
		monitoring assay performance</a> and identification of anomalies 
		produced by the enzyme formulation such as
		<a href="../issues/profile_arcing.html">profile arcing</a>. </p>
		<p>It is thus recommended that a standard calibration reaction set 
		consisting of 100 fg lambda gDNA and CAL1 be included during 
		implementation of LRE, in order to assess the general performance of 
		your instrument and reaction setup.</p>

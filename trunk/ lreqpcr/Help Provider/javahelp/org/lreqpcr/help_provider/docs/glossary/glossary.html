		<p><b><a name="Absolute_Quantification">Absolute Quantification</a>:</b> 
		determination of the number of target molecules, based on an absolute 
		quantitative scale generated by a quantitative standard. Using 
		conventional qPCR methods, this requires construction of a 
		target-specific standard curve, as compared to LRE in which absolute 
		scale is determined by <a href="#OCF">optical calibration</a> using 
		lambda gDNA as a universal quantitative standard. </p>
		<p><b><a name="Amplicon_Database">Amplicon Database</a>:</b> is a 
		database file with a *.amp extension that stores amplicon information</p>
		<p><b><a name="Amplification_profile">Amplification profile</a>:</b> is 
		the fundamental unit of real-time PCR in which the increase in amplicon 
		DNA is determined by measuring reaction fluorescence at the end of each 
		cycle. Also referred to as the <a href="#FC_Plot">F<sub>C</sub> plot</a>, 
		an amplification profile is generated by plotting reaction fluorescence 
		against cycle number.&nbsp; </p>
		<p><b><a name="Average_F0">Average F<sub>0</sub></a>:</b> target 
		quantity expressed in fluorescence units, produced by averaging the
		<a href="#Cycle_F0">cycle F<sub>0</sub></a> values generated by the 
		cycles within the <a href="#LRE_Window">LRE window</a>.</p>
		<p><a name="Average_Profile"><b>Average Profile</b>:</a> an 
		amplification profile generated by averaging, for each cycle, the 
		fluorescence readings from the 
		corresponding <a href="#Replicate_Profile">replicate profiles</a> to 
		produce a &quot;average&quot; amplification profile. 
		Average profiles are automatically constructed by the LRE Analyzer 
		during data import. Although this can greatly increase the <a href="#Read_Precision">read precision</a> that in 
		turn increases the precision of target quantification, it does assume 
		that the respective replicate profiles are tightly clustered. This 
		approach becomes less effective if the replicate profiles are scattered. 
		An extreme example of this occurs when target quantities fall below 10 
		molecules per reaction due to the impact of Poisson Distribution. Under 
		such situations, target quantity should be determined by averaging the 
		quantities produced by each individual replicate reaction. A detailed 
		description of the impact of Poisson Distribution is presented in the 
		third video of the LRE Overview presented on the LRE qPCR website (<font color="#FF0000">sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr</font>). </p>
		<p><b><a name="Average_Replicate_F0_CV">Average Replicate-F<sub>0</sub> 
		CV</a>: </b>is an indicator of the overall precision of target 
		quantification, based on the variation (CV) of&nbsp; F<sub>0</sub> 
		determinations generated by the technical replicates contained within 
		either an Experiment or Calibration database</p>
		<p><b><a name="C1/2">C<sub>1/2</sub></a></b>: the fractional cycle at 
		which reaction fluorescence reaches half of <a href="#Fmax">F<sub>max</sub></a> 
		(which roughly corresponds to the middle of most amplification profiles) 
		and is primarily used to define the position of an amplification 
		profile, similar but not identical to that of C<sub>q</sub> (AKA C<sub>t</sub> 
		and C<sub>p</sub>).</p>

		<p><b><a name="Cycle_Efficiency">Cycle Efficiency</a></b>: generally referred to as E<sub>C</sub>, defines amplification 
		efficiency as the increase in amplicon DNA quantity produced over a 
		single cycle, relative to the amount of amplicon DNA present at the 
		beginning of the cycle. For real-time PCR using SYBR Green I, the amount 
		of amplicon DNA present at the end of a cycle is reflected by the 
		fluorescence reading generated by that cycle (F<sub>C</sub>), whereas 
		the amount of amplicon DNA present at the beginning of the cycle is 
		reflected by the fluorescent reading produced by the previous cycle 
		(F<sub>C-1</sub>). Cycle efficiency, which is normally expressed as a 
		percentage, is calculated by dividing the these two values:</p>

		<p>The sorting panel provides two windows that allow profiles that to be 
		organized by either amplicon or sample: </p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/sorting_panel.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">When an experiment or calibration database window is 
		selected, these two windows become active. Selecting either of these 
		windows produces a list of all the amplicon or 
		samples, contained within the database. In this example, this produces a list of the 
		four amplicons contained within the demonstration experiment database: </p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amplicon_window.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">Note that the average E<sub>max</sub> is presented in the label, 
		along with the standard deviation generated by all of the profiles 
		produced by the amplicon. Selecting an amplicon generates a list of 
		the nine profiles contained within the experiment database that were produced 
		using this 
		amplicon :</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amplicon_window2.gif"></p>
		<p align="center"><b>Experiment Window<br>
		</b>
		<img border="0" src="images/amplicon_window3.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">Selection of any of these 
		profiles will trigger the profile editor window to appear. 
		Conversely, if a sample is selected in the sample sorting window, all of 
		the profiles generated by that sample will be displayed within the 
		explorer database window, and again selection of any of these profiles 
		will trigger the profile editor window to appear.</p>
		<p align="left">To return to viewing the runs, click on the run view button:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/expt_run_view.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">Calibration profiles contained within a calibration 
		database can also be viewed in this fashion. </p>
    	<p align="left">Note also that both of the sorting windows can 
		&quot;slide&quot; into the right hand border by clicking on the
		<img border="0" src="images/slide_button.gif" width="22" height="18"> 
		button located on the right top of the panel:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/slide_in1.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">When slide in the windows can then be opened by clicking on, or hovering the mouse 
		over the corresponding window button. The windows can also be 
		locked back into place by clicking on the black circle 
		located at the top right of the window.</p>

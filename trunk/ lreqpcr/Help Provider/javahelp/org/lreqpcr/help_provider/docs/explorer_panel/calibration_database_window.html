        <h1 align="center">Calibration Database Window</h1>
		<p>The Calibration Database Window root presents the name of the 
		database, along with the average Fmax ±CV generated across all the runs contained 
		within the database (see <a href="../lre_adjust/fmax_normalization.htm">
		Fmax Normalization</a> for more information regarding the average Fmax). 
		All of the runs contained in the database are presented as a tree below 
		this root node, which present the run data, name, and average OCF 
		generated by the run&#39;s calibration profiles, along with a 
		±CV if more than one amplicon was included in the run, as is the case 
		for these examples. The OCF box just above the tree panel presents the 
		average <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#OCF">OCF</a> ±CV generated by 
		all of the average calibration profiles contained within the database. </p>
    	<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_tree.gif"></p>
		<p align="left"><a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Calibration_Profile">
		Calibration profiles</a> 
		contained within a Run can be view by expanding a run branch by either 
		double clicking on the branch or clicking on the&nbsp;
		<img border="0" src="images/experi16.gif"> on the left of the branch:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_replic_profiles.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">This presents the
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average calibration profiles</a> 
		conducted within the run, which in this case consisted of two 
		calibration amplicons, CAL1 and CAL2, as indicated within the average 
		profile labels. The sample name (LAM), Emax (<a href="../lre_adjust/high_emax.html">fixed 
		to 100%</a> in this case) and corresponding OCF are also presented in 
		the average profile labels. </p>
		<p align="left">Similarly, the
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Replicate_Profile">
		replicate profiles</a> can be viewed by expanding the average profile 
		branch, which in this case consisted of six replicate reactions:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_replic_profiles2.gif" width="283" height="162"></p>
		<p align="left">Note that the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#LRE_Analysis">LRE analysis</a> of the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile</a> is independent of 
		that conducted on the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Replicate_Profile">replicate profiles</a>. 
		</p>
		<p align="left">Note also that a replicate calibration profile can be excluded/included 
		by right clicking the 
		profile:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_replic_profiles_exclude.gif" width="290" height="138"></p>
		<p align="left">&quot;EXCLUDED&quot; is added to the label to signify that this 
		replicate profile is not included into the average profile:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/exclude_profile2.gif"></p>
		<p>This will then trigger recalculation of the average profile using the 
		remaining replicate profiles, and automated LRE analysis conducted on 
		the new average profile. An excluded replicate profile can also be 
		included, and again the average profile is updated to include the 
		including replicate profile. </p>
		<p>Average profiles can also be deleted by right clicking and selecting 
		&quot;Delete Profile(s)&quot;. Note also that multiple average profiles or runs 
		can be deleted simultaneously deleted by multiple selection using the 
		Shift or Ctrl key:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_average_profiles_delete.gif" width="343" height="251"></p>
		<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>IMPORTANT</b></font>: Note that there is no undo function in this 
		version of the LRE Analyzer, so once an average profile is deleted, there is no 
		way to recovery it.</p>
		<p align="left">Also note that similar to a replicate profile, an 
		average calibration profile can be excluded, which removes it from the average OCF (see below):</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_average_profiles_exclude.gif" width="240" height="136"></p>
		<p align="left">The primary function of a Calibration Database is to 
		provide an average OCF, which is displayed above the profile tree:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/average_ocf.gif" width="181" height="48"></p>
		<p align="left">The &quot;Average Profile OCF&quot; is derived from the 
		average profiles, which is used to manually enter an 
		OCF into an Experimental Database. The CV, which here is ±14.6%, 
		provides an indication of the run to run variance. This introduces 
		the second major functionality of optical calibration, which is to 
		provide the ability to<a href="../quality_control/monitoring_assay_performance.html"> 
		monitor run to run variability</a>. </p>
		<p>The function of the Run View button is described in the 
		<a href="../sorting_panel/sorting_panel_overview.html">Sort View 
		Panel</a>.</p>

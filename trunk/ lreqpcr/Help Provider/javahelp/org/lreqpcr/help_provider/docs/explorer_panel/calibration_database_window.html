        <h1 align="center">Calibration Database Window</h1>
		<p>The Calibration Database Window displays data elements contained within 
		a calibration database file, which consists of 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Calibration_Profile">calibration profiles</a> 
		produced over multiple Runs. When first opened, a calibration database 
		will appear as a simple list of
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profiles</a> 
		under a single branched called &quot;Reaction Setup&quot;, which in this version 
		is purely symbolic:</p>
    	<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_tree.gif" width="306" height="227"></p>
		<p align="left">Each calibration profile label consists of: &quot;Run Date 
		Amplicon (Emax) OCF&quot;, where OCF is the
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#OCF">optical calibration factor</a> 
		generated by the calibration profile. </p>
		<p align="left">An average profile branch can be expanded to reveal the 
		respective <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Replicate_Profile">
		Replicate Profiles</a>:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_replic_profiles.gif" width="254" height="162"></p>
		<p align="left">Note that the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#LRE_Analysis">LRE analysis</a> of the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile</a> is independent of 
		that conducted on the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Replicate_Profile">replicate profiles</a>. 
		However, right clicking on a replicate profile will present a 
		fly out menu that allows a replicate profile to be excluded:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_replic_profiles_exclude.gif" width="290" height="138"></p>
		<p align="left">&quot;EXCLUDED&quot; is added to the label to signify that this 
		replicate profile is not included into the average profile:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/exclude_profile2.gif" width="257" height="73"></p>
		<p>This will then trigger recalculation of the average profile using the 
		remaining replicate profiles, and automated LRE analysis conducted on 
		the new average profile. An excluded replicate profile can also be 
		included, and again the average profile is updated to include the 
		including replicate profile. </p>
		<p>Average profiles can be deleted by right clicking and selecting 
		&quot;Delete Profile(s)&quot;. Note also that multiple average profiles or runs 
		can be deleted simultaneously deleted by multiple selection using the 
		Shift or Ctrl key:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_average_profiles_delete.gif" width="343" height="251"></p>
		<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>IMPORTANT</b></font>: Note that there is no undo function in this 
		version of the LRE Analyzer, so once an average profile is deleted, there is no 
		way to recovery it.</p>
		<p align="left">Also note that similar to a replicate profile, an 
		average calibration profile can be excluded, which removes it, along 
		with its replicate profiles, from the average OCF (see below):</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/cal_average_profiles_exclude.gif" width="240" height="136"></p>
		<p align="left">The primary function of a Calibration Database is to 
		provide an average OCF, which is displayed above the profile tree:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/average_ocf.gif" width="181" height="48"></p>
		<p align="left">The &quot;Average Profile OCF&quot; is derived from the 
		average profiles, which is normally the value used to manually enter an 
		OCF into an Experimental Database. The CV, which here is Â±14.6%, 
		provides an indication of the run to run repeatability. This introduces 
		the second major functionality of optical calibration, which is to 
		provide the ability to<a href="../quality_control/monitoring_assay_performance.html"> 
		monitor run to run variability</a>. </p>
		<p>The function of the Run View button is described in the 
		<a href="../sorting_panel/sorting_panel_overview.html">Sort View 
		Panel</a>.</p>

		<p>Some enzyme formulations have been found to generate profiles with 
		extensive arcing. Such profiles do not conform well to the LRE model and 
		can thus generate unreliable quantifications. This is a profile 
		generated with CAL1 and 100 fg of lambda gDNA in which the enzyme 
		formulation produced extensive profile arcing:</p>

		for LRE analysis include Qiagen QuantiTect, Agilent Brilliant II, and 
		Invitrogen Platinum SYBR, although many other formulations are also likely to be

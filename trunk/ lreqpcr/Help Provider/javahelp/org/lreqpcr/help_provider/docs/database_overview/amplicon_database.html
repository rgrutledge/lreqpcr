		<p>An amplicon database stores information about individual amplicons, 
		which are presented as a simple list based on the name of the amplicon. 
		The primary function of an amplicon database is to provide amplicon 
		sizes during run import. Selection of a amplicon will trigger the
		<a href="../editor_panel/amplicon_editor_window.html">Amplicon Editor 
		Window</a> to appear, 
		allow viewing/editing of the information associated with the amplicon. </p>

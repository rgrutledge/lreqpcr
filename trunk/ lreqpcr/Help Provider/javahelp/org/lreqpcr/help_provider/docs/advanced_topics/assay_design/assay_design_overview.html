		<p>One of the major limitations of conducting large scale qPCR is the 
		inability to optimize cycling regime to individual primer pairs. 
		particularly when a large number of targets need to be quantified,&nbsp; 
		it is necessary to use a single cycle regime.</p>
		<p>One of the largest limitations for large scale qPCR applications 
		isn&#39;t is a necessity to forgo extensive testing and optimization of 
		individual primer sets. Instead, it&#39;s necessary to develop general 
		design principles that allow large numbers of primers to be designed 
		with the expectation that the vast majority of primers will perform 
		well. In addition, </p>

        <h1 align="center">Introduction to the LRE Analyzer</h1>
		<p>It is recommended that once an initial understanding of the program 
		has been obtained, the demonstration database files be opened in order 
		to provide a hands-on introduction to LRE using high quality datasets. 
		It is also recommended that before attempting to analyze your own 
		datasets, <a href="implementing_lre_assays.html">Implementing 
		LRE-based Assays</a> be consulted.</p>
		<p>The user interface is organized into three panels, each containing windows that provide functions 
		for viewing and/or editing of data:</p>
		<p align="center"><map name="FPMap0">
		<area href="#Explorer_Panel" shape="rect" coords="26, 37, 138, 187">
		<area href="#Editing_Panel" shape="rect" coords="143, 36, 282, 188">
		<area href="#Overview_Panel_" shape="rect" coords="286, 37, 393, 187">
		</map>
		<img border="0" src="images/ui.gif" width="424" height="452" usemap="#FPMap0"></p>
		<p><b><a name="Explorer_Panel">Explorer Panel</a></b></p>
		<p align="left">The Explorer Panel<b> </b>provides three windows for 
		viewing data from each of the three
		<a href="../database_overview/database_overview.html">LRE database types:</a></p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/explorer2.gif"></p>
		<p>Once a database file is opened, its data is presented as a tree. 
		Selecting a data element within the tree will trigger the corresponding 
		Editing Window to appear within the Editing Panel (see below). </p>
		<p>See the <a href="../explorer_panel/explorer_panel_overview.html">Explorer Panel Overview</a> for a more detailed description.</p>
		<p><b><a name="Editing_Panel">Editing Panel</a></b></p>
		<p>The Editing Panel located in the center of the user interface, contains two windows for editing 
		of either profiles or amplicons:
		</p>
		<p><b>Profile Editor:</b></p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/editor_profile.gif" width="389" height="378"></p>
		<p align="left">
		<b>Amplicon Editor:</b></p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/editor_amplicon.gif" width="398" height="356"></p>
		<p>Depending on which database is displayed in the Explorer Panel and 
		what type of data element is selected, the corresponding editing window will 
		open to display information about the data element, much of which can be edited. 
		</p>
		<p align="left">
		The profile editing window provides the core functionality of the LRE 
		Analyzer and is the most complex, comprised of a number of panels that 
		display information about the selected profile. See the
		<a href="../editor_panel/profile_editor_window.html">Profile Editor 
		Window</a> page for a detailed overview. The
		<a href="../explorer_panel/amplicon_database_window.html">Amplicon 
		Database Window</a> and
		<a href="../editor_panel/amplicon_editor_window.html">Amplicon Editor 
		Window</a> provide details of how the amplicon editor window functions. </p>
		<p><b><a name="Overview_Panel_">Sorting Panel</a></b></p>
		<p>The Sorting Panel located on the right side of the user interface, contains two windows that 
		allow viewing of amplification profiles, sorted by 
			either amplicon or sample. These windows become functional when either an 
		Experiment or Calibration database is displayed in the Explorer 
		Panel</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/sorting_amplicon.gif" width="288" height="278"></p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/sorting_sample.gif" width="290" height="277"></p>
		<p align="left">
		Selecting one of these data elements will display, within the Explorer 
		Panel, a list of all profiles generated with the selected amplicon or 
		sample.
		This in turn allows review/editing or export of a subset of profiles 
		contained within the database, irrespective of the Run in 
		which they were generated. </p>
		<p align="left">
		Note also that the amplicon/sample labels 
		provide the average amplification efficiency generated across all of the 
		corresponding profiles. To return to viewing runs, select the &quot;Run View&quot; 
		button within the explorer window.&nbsp;
		See the <a href="../sorting_panel/sorting_panel_overview.html">Sorting Panel Overview</a> for a more detailed description. </p>

        <h1 align="center">Generating an OCF</h1>
		<p><b>Quick start using a crude OCF estimate</b></p>
		<p>Although this method is not recommended, empirical observation has 
		indicated that OCF values generated by an optical calibration reaction 
		(as described below) are often close to 5% of the average F<sub>max</sub>. The 
		demonstration experiment database provides a nice illustration of this, 
		in that 5% the average F<sub>max</sub> (2.49x10<sup>6</sup>) is 
		~125,000, which is close to the average OCF generated by the 
		demonstration calibration database (130,000).&nbsp; Note however, that this has not been extensively 
		tested and thus may not generate a reliable OCF estimate. </p>
		<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
		<p>An optical calibration factor or OCF is generated by amplifying a known quantity of 
		lambda gDNA using a high performance lambda primer-pair such as CAL1 or 
		CAL2. 
		Importantly, the amplification reactions and amplification conditions 
		must be identical to that used for sample amplification. The resulting 
		amplification profiles are referred as calibration profiles. </p>
		<p>CAL1 5&#39; primer: AGACGAATGCCAGGTCATCTGAAACAG<br>
		CAL1 3&#39; primer: CTTTTGCTCTGCGATGCTGATACCG</p>
		<p>Lambda gDNA is diluted with 10 mM Tris using siliconized microfuge 
		tubes, to a final concentration of 100 femtograms per
		<font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l, which is equivalent to 1,876 
		genomes. Note that bulk preparations of&nbsp;diluted lambda gDNA that also 
		includes a X10 concentration of primers (e.g. 5000 nM/<font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l 
		for a 500 nM final concentration in a 10 <font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l reactions) 
		can be used to standardize optical calibration over long 
		periods of time, in addition to providing a single source of calibration 
		mix that can be applied to multiple instruments or reaction setups (e.g. 
		different enzyme formulations). </p>
		<p>A standard reaction setup that has been found to be effective, uses as 
		a reaction volume of 10 <font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l 
		containing 100 fg of lambda gDNA, amplified in a 
		white plate sealed with film. Typically, four replicate CAL1 reactions are included 
		in 
		each run.</p>
		<p>As described in the
		<a href="../explorer_panel/calibration_database_window.html">optical 
		calibration explorer window</a> overview, calibration profiles are stored 
		in a dedicated database, from which an average OCF is derived from multiple runs. As described in the
		<a href="../explorer_panel/experiment_database_window.html">experiment 
		explorer window overview</a>, an average OCF is manually entered, which 
		is then applied to all runs within the experiment database.</p>
		<p><b>Mathematics</b></p>
		<p>Optical calibration quantifies the fluorescence intensity of an assay 
		based on the average F<sub>0</sub> generated by a calibration profile 
		using the equation:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/lambda_ocf_equation.gif" width="168" height="57"></p>
		<p>
		M<sub>0</sub> is 
		equivalent to the mass of the amplicon region within the target 
		expressed in nanograms of dsDNA, which for lambda is calculated using the 
		equation:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/lambda_mo.gif" width="219" height="62"></p>
		<p>
		where &quot;ng Lambda&quot; is the nanograms of lambda gDNA that was amplified, A<sub>S
		</sub>is the amplicon size and 48,502 bp is the genome size of lambda in base 
		pairs. </p>

		As described in the <a href="optical_calibration_overview.html">optical 
		calibration overview</a>, an OCF is used to convert target quantities 
		expressed in fluorescence units to the number of target molecules. </p>

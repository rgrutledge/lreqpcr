		<p>Go to the directory in which the LRE Analyzer was installed (e.g.
		"C:/Program Files/lreanalyzerXXX" which is the default for Windows), which 
		should contain the following files and directories:</p>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/uninst7.jpg"></p>
		<p> Delete the Settings.lre file, or if you wish to keep your settings, 
		move the Settings.lre file to a temporary location. Start the uninstall.exe 
		program and follow the instructions. After installing a new version, move 
		the Settings.lre file back to the installation directory, or, if it is absent a 
		new Settings.lre file will created when the program is first opened.&nbsp; </p>

To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:

(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)

<h1 align="center">F<sub>max</sub> Normalization</h1>

<p>Due to the fact that LRE quantification is based on fluorescence units, 
target quantification is directly dependent on the fluorescence units generated 
the qPCR instrument. As such, any variance in fluorescence scale will impact 
quantitative accuracy. Extensive use of lambda gDNA as a quantitative standard 
for optical calibration has indicated that this is generally not a concern. 
Indeed, this is the basis of being able to use a single optical calibration 
factor (OCF) for convering target quantities into the number of molecules. REF?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However, closer examination revealed significant differences in well to well 
fluorescence intensity can occur, which can generate quantitative errors in the 
range of 0.5- to 2.0-fold. Provide an example... While such variance was 
generally found to be small for most instruments, a simple method for 
quantifying and correcting for such variances was implemented, based on profile 
height (AKA, the plateau region). Under the LRE model profile height is 
expressed as F<sub>max</sub>, which is one of the variables used to determine 
target quantity (F<sub>0</sub>). Provide a link.</p>
<p>Because F<sub>max</sub> is directly related to fluorescence scale within 
individual wells (assuming of course that the amplification reaction generated a 
profile), it first provides the ability to quantify variance in fluorescence 
scale across all wells within a run. This is accomplished by determining the 
average F<sub>max</sub> , along with the coefficient of&nbsp; variation (CV = 
standard deviation / average X 100%). In addition to providing the ability to 
determine both intra and inter run variance in fluorescent scale, the average F<sub>max</sub> 
provides a reference for normalizing the fluorescence units within individual 
wells. </p>
<p>For example, if a profile generates a F<sub>max</sub> that is 25% higher that 
the run average F<sub>max</sub>, it will generate ~25% overestimation of target 
quantity</p>

<h1 align="center">F<sub>max</sub> Normalization</h1>

<p>Due to the fact that LRE determines target quantity expressed fluorescence 
units, quantitative accuracy is directly dependent on the optical precision of 
the qPCR instrument. Extensive work with optical calibration using lambda gDNA 
as a quantitative standard, has indicated that this is generally not a major 
concern. However, close examination has revealed that significant well to well 
differences in fluorescence intensity can occur, at least for some instruments, 
which can generate quantitative errors in the range of 0.5- to 2.0-fold. While 
such variance has generally been found to be small, a simple method for 
quantifying and correcting such variances was developed, based on comparing 
profile height. Under the LRE model the maximal fluorescence (F<sub>max</sub>) 
is a quantitative measurement of profile height, that in turn </p>
<p>, and so is available . Provide a link.</p>
<p>Because profile height is directly linked to the fluorescence scale, F<sub>max</sub> 
can be used to quantify differences between individual wells, in addition to 
differences between runs. This is expressed as the coefficient of&nbsp; 
variation (CV = standard deviation / average X 100%) along with the average F<sub>max</sub> 
which in turn provides a reference for normalizing the fluorescence units within 
each individual well within a run, in addition to providing the ability to 
assess both intra and inter run variance in fluorescent scale. </p>
<p>For example, if a profile generates a F<sub>max</sub> that is 25% higher that 
the average F<sub>max</sub>, it will generate ~25% overestimation of target 
quantity. When F<sub>max</sub> normalization is applied, this bias is corrected 
by simply lowering the predicted target quantity by 25%.</p>
<p>The average F<sub>max</sub> also allows run to run differences in 
fluorescence scale to be assessed, by comparing their respective average F<sub>max</sub> 
values. The average F<sub>max</sub> across all runs contained within a database, 
is presented in the top node within the profile explorer tree panel, along with 
the corresponding CV. Although these differences are generally small (&lt;10%), 
this does allow any aberrations in the optical intensity of a run to be easily 
identified. This could be produced, for example, by technical errors in reaction 
setup or aberrations in an instrument optical system. Although such situations 
are expected to be rare, it does pr</p>

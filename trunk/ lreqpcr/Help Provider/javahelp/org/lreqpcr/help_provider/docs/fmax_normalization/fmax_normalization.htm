<h1 align="center">F<sub>max</sub> Normalization</h1>

<p>Fmax normalization corrects for well-to-well differences in fluorescence 
calibration, that is, differences in the fluorescence scale assigned by the 
instrument to each individual well. While the impact of variances in 
well-specific calibration is generally small , the simplistic natural of Fmax 
normalization makes it an attractive option for potentially increasing the 
accuracy of LRE quantification, which can be significant in some cases. As 
discussed below, analysis of a run's average Fmax also introduces an additional 
quality control component that is available whether Fmax normalization is 
implemented or not. </p>
<p>So how can&nbsp; of fluorescence calibration be analyzed, and how does it 
impact quantitative accuracy? Due to the fact that LRE determines target quantity expressed fluorescence 
units, quantitative accuracy is directly dependent on the optical precision of 
the qPCR instrument. Extensive use of optical calibration, conducted with lambda gDNA, has 
historically indicated that for most modern qPCR instruments, this is not a major 
concern. However, close examination has revealed that significant well-to-well 
differences in fluorescence scale can still occur, despite the high levels of 
optical precision that these instruments generate. </p>
<p>Although still under investigation, 
such variances have been found to generate quantitative errors in the range of 0.5- to 2.0-fold, 
based on comparing quantification of identical samples amplified within 
different wells. Further examination revealed that these differences correlated 
directly to the height of each respective profile, which in the absence of any 
other factor, directly reflects differences in the fluorescence units assigned 
by the instrument, to each respective well. Should provide a graphic 
illustrating this.</p>
<p>Under the LRE model, quantifying profile height is an integral component of 
target quantification, defined as the maximal fluorescence, F<sub>max</sub>. 
This in turn provides a simple but quantitative approach to addressing variances 
in instrument calibration, including the </p>
<p>The approach taken in this version of the LRE Analyzer is to first determine 
the average F<sub>max</sub> across all wells within an individual run.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the simplicity of 
quantifying and correcting such variances was developed, based on comparing 
profile height. Under the LRE model the maximal fluorescence (F<sub>max</sub>) 
is a quantitative measurement of profile height, that in turn </p>
<p>, and so is available . Provide a link.</p>
<p>Because profile height is directly linked to the fluorescence scale, F<sub>max</sub> 
can be used to quantify differences between individual wells, in addition to 
differences between runs. This is expressed as the coefficient of&nbsp; 
variation (CV = standard deviation / average X 100%) along with the average F<sub>max</sub> 
which in turn provides a reference for normalizing the fluorescence units within 
each individual well within a run, in addition to providing the ability to 
assess both intra and inter run variance in fluorescent scale. </p>
<p>For example, if a profile generates a F<sub>max</sub> that is 25% higher that 
the average F<sub>max</sub>, it will generate ~25% overestimation of target 
quantity. When F<sub>max</sub> normalization is applied, this bias is corrected 
by simply lowering the predicted target quantity by 25%.</p>
<p>The average F<sub>max</sub> also allows run to run differences in 
fluorescence scale to be assessed, by comparing their respective average F<sub>max</sub> 
values. The average F<sub>max</sub> across all runs contained within a database, 
is presented in the top node within the profile explorer tree panel, along with 
the corresponding CV. Although these differences are generally small (&lt;10%), 
this does allow any aberrations in the optical intensity of a run to be easily 
identified. This could be produced, for example, by technical errors in reaction 
setup or aberrations in an instrument optical system. Although such situations 
are expected to be rare, it does pr</p>

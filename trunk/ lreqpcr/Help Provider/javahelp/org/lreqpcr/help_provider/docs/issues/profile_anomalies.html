		<p>For unknown reasons, some amplicons produce anomalies within the 
		upper regions of an amplification profile. These are referred to as 
		&quot;plateau drift&quot; and &quot;profile collapse&quot;:</p>

		<p align="left">As discussed in the
		<a href="../lre_window_selection/automated_window_selection.html">
		automated LRE window selection</a> section, it is important not to 
		include these anomalous cycles into the LRE window. Depending on the 
		severity it is recommended that such amplicons be replaced.</p>
		<p align="left">As discussed in the <a href="high_emax.html">E<sub>max</sub> 
		normalization</a> section, kinetic anomalies have also been found to 
		generate systematic biases which generate E<sub>max</sub> values &gt;100%.</p>

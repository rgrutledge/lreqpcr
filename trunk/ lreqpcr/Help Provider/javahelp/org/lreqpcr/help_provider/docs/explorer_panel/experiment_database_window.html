        <h1 align="center">Experiment Database Window</h1>
		<p>The Experiment Database Window displays data elements stored within 
		an experiment database file, which consists of a series of associated 
		runs. When an experiment database is first opened, all of the runs 
		within the database will be presented as a tree:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/experi5.gif" width="437" height="125"></p>
		<p>The root presents the name of 
		the database file. Each Run within the database file is then listed as 
		branches, with the date, name and average Fmax Â±CV of the run presented in the branch 
		label. Profiles within a Run can be view by expanding a Run branch by 
		either double clicking on the branch or clicking on the&nbsp;
		<img border="0" src="images/experi16.gif"> on the left of the branch:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/expt2.gif" width="296" height="252"></p>
		<p>This presents each
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile </a>&nbsp;as 
		a branch below the respective Run. Each profile label provide 
		information about the LRE analysis
		<a href="mailto:(Amplicon@Sampl" style="text-decoration: none">
		<font color="#000000">[Amplicon@Sampl</font></a>e (E<sub>max</sub>)&nbsp; 
		N= # 
		of Target Molecules]</p>
		<p>An average profile branch can be expanded to show the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Replicate_Profile">replicate 
		profiles</a>:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/replicate_sample_list.gif"></p>
		<p>Note that the <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#LRE_Analysis">LRE analysis</a> of the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile</a> is independent of 
		that conducted on the 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Replicate_Profile">replicate profiles</a>. 
		However, right clicking on a replicate profile will present a 
		fly out menu that allows the profile to be excluded:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/exclude_profile1.gif"></p>
		<p>&quot;EXCLUDED&quot; is added to the label to signify that this replicate 
		profile is not included into the average profile:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/exclude_profile2.gif"></p>
		<p>This will then trigger recalculation of the average profile using the 
		remaining replicate profiles, and an automated LRE analysis conducted on 
		the new average profile. An excluded replicate profile can also be 
		included, and again the average profile is updated to include the 
		replicate profile. </p>
		<p>Similarly, average profiles and runs can be deleted by right clicking 
		and selecting &quot;Delete...&quot;. Note also that multiple average profiles or 
		runs can be deleted simultaneously deleted by multiple selection using 
		the Shift or Ctrl key in combination with the mouse left click:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/delete_profile.gif"></p>
		<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>IMPORTANT</b></font>: Note that there is no undo function in this 
		version of the LRE Analyzer, so once a run or profile is deleted, there is no 
		way to recovery it.</p>
		<p>Above the Run tree, a calibration factor (<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#OCF">OCF</a>) 
		can be manually entered, along with checkboxes that implement fixing
		<a href="../lre_adjust/high_emax.html">Emax to 100%</a> and
		<a href="../lre_adjust/fmax_normalization.htm">Fmax Normalization</a>:</p>
    	<p align="center">

		<p>The
		<a href="../optical_calibration/optical_calibration_overview.html">
		optical calibration overview</a> provides details about how an OCF is 
		derived and how it is used to convert target quantities into the number 
		of molecules. The function of the Run View button is described in the 
		<a href="../sorting_panel/sorting_panel_overview.html">Sort View 
		Panel</a>.</p>

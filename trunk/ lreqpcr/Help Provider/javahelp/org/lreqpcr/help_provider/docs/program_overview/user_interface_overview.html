		<p>As described in the
		<a href="../database_overview/database_overview.html">LRE Databases</a> 
		section, the LRE Analyzer employs three database types for storing 
		sample profiles, calibration profiles and amplicons, respectively. The 
		program is thus designed to display and allow editing of each of theses 
		data types. </p>
		<p>The user interface is organized into three panels, each containing windows that provide functions 
		for viewing and/or editing of data:</p>
		<p align="center"><map name="FPMap0">
		<area href="../sorting_panel/sorting_panel_overview.html" shape="rect" coords="287, 36, 392, 187">
		<area href="../editor_panel/editor_panel_overview.html" shape="rect" coords="141, 36, 283, 187">
		<area href="../editor_panel/editor_panel_overview.html" shape="rect" coords="26, 38, 137, 186">
		</map>

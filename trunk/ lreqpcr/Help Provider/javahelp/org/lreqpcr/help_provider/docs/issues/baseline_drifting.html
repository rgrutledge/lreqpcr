      	<p align="left">As was described in the first LRE paper (<a href="#Rutledge_">Rutledge 
		and Stewart 2008)</a>, baseline drifting is one of the most acute 
		anomalies encountered to date, which is best visualized by turning off 
		baseline subtraction and zooming into the baseline region of a profile:</p>

		<p>When such profiles are viewed in the LRE plot, a characteristic hook 
		is generated in the earliest region of the plot:</p>

		drift<br>

		<p>This is a major concern, as baseline drifting generates large 
		underestimations in E<sub>max</sub>, which here is 87.6% for an amplicon 
		known to generate E<sub>max</sub> close to 100% in the absence of 
		baseline drifting. This will in turn generate a large overestimation of 
		target quantity.</p>
		<p>Although the mechanism of baseline drifting is not clear, both 
		primer- and sample-specific factors have been encountered. Such primers 
		need to be replaced, whereas diluting the sample or re-purifying the RNA 
		before reverse transcription have been found to reduce baseline drifting 
		for some samples. </p>

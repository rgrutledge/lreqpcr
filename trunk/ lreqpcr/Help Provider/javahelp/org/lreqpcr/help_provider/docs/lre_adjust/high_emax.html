        <h1 align="center">E<sub>max</sub> Normalization</h1>
      	<p>Emax normalization is applied by selecting the checkbox ("&lt;100%&gt; 
		Emax") located just above the explorer panel tree. In addition, the LRE 
		derived Emax displayed in the profile node label is replaced by "&lt;100%&gt; 
		to signify that Emax has been fixed to 100%. Note that Emax 
		normalization is applied to all profiles contained within the database. 
		To return to the LRE-derived Emax , simply deselect the checkbox. </p>
		<p>Particularly for Qiagen&#39;s QuantiTect enzyme formulation, LRE 
		analysis has been found to generate Emax values &gt;100%, which are most 
		likely due to aberrant amplification kinetics that produce systematic 
		biases in Emax determination (the source of these aberrancies remains 
		unknown). Depending on the amplicon, Emax can reach up to 107-110%, 
		although most amplicons generate Emax values 
		in the 100-104% range. Empirical testing has shown that a 1% 
		overestimation roughly generates a 10% underestimation of target quantity, 
		although this relationship is not linear (i.e. the overestimation 
		increases as the Emax bias becomes larger). </p>
		<p>Extensive testing has subsequently shown that fixing Emax to 100% is 
		effective in reducing, or in many cases eliminating, the quantitative 
		errors caused by this systematic bias. A key component of this testing was to use &quot;limiting dilution assay&quot; 
		(LDA) to provide an independent determination of target quantity, which 
		has shown that fixing to Emax to 100% produces target quantities within 
		15-30% of the actual quantity, even for amplicons that generate Emax values of 107-110%. As discussed in the
		<a href="../quantitative_accuracy/assessing_accuracy.html">verification 
		of quantitative accuracy</a> section, LDA is simple to conduct and does 
		not require a quantitative standard, thus providing a compelling 
		methodology for confirmation of the quantitative accuracy of any qPCR 
		assay, irrespective of how it is implemented</p>
		<p>Note that fixing Emax to 100% does not 
		modify any of the other parameters used to calculate target quantity. 
		This is because 100% Emax is applied only during
		<a href="../lre_overview/lre_introduction.html#Fo determination">calculation of target 
		quantity</a> (F<sub>0</sub>), in which the Fmax is derived from the
		<a href="../lre_overview/lre_introduction.html#LRE Analysis">LRE 
		analysis</a> conducted on the profile. </p>

        <h1 align="center">Fixing E<sub>max</sub> to 100%</h1>
      	<p>Selecting the "&lt;100%&gt; 
		Emax" checkbox located just above the explorer panel tree will fix Emax 
		to 100% for all profiles within the database. In addition, the LRE derived Emax displayed in the profile node label is replaced by "&lt;100%&gt;&quot; 
		to signify that Emax has been fixed to 100%. Deselecting the checkbox 
		will return to the LRE-derived Emax . </p>
		<p>This option was introduced in an attempt to correct for biases in 
		Emax determination produced by Qiagen&#39;s QuantiTect enzyme formulation, 
		which consistently generates Emax values &gt;100%. Depending on the amplicon and 
		batch of enzyme , 
		LRE-derived Emax estimates can be &gt;110%, although Emax values in the 
		100-104% range are most typical. Empirical testing has shown 
		that a 1% overestimation roughly generates a 10% underestimation 
		of target quantity, although this relationship is not linear so that the 
		overestimation become larger with Emax values above 105%. </p>
		<p>Extensive testing has subsequently shown that fixing Emax to 100% is 
		effective in reducing, or in many cases eliminating, the quantitative 
		errors caused by this systematic bias. A key component of this testing was to use &quot;limiting dilution assay&quot; 
		(LDA) to provide an independent determination of target quantity, which 
		has shown that fixing to Emax to 100% produces target quantities within 
		15-30% of the actual quantity, even for amplicons that generate Emax values of 107-110%. As discussed in the
		<a href="../quantitative_accuracy/assessing_accuracy.html">verification 
		of quantitative accuracy</a> section, LDA is simple to conduct and does 
		not require a quantitative standard, thus providing a compelling 
		methodology for confirmation of the quantitative accuracy of any qPCR 
		assay, irrespective of how it is implemented.</p>
		<p>Note that fixing Emax to 100% does not 
		modify any of the other parameters used to calculate target quantity. 
		This is because 100% Emax is applied only during
		<a href="../lre_overview/lre_introduction.html#Fo determination">calculation of target 
		quantity</a> (F<sub>0</sub>), and does not impact Fmax, which is derived 
		from <a href="../lre_overview/lre_introduction.html#LRE Analysis">LRE 
		analysis</a>. </p>

		<p align="left">If you are unfamiliar with LRE, the
		<a href="../lre_overview/lre_introduction.html">LRE introduction</a> 
		page provides an overview that should provide a basic understanding of LRE. The three LRE 
		overview videos available on the LRE web site (<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr"><font color="#FF0000">sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr</font></a>) 
		also provides a more technical description of the origins and 
		implementation of LRE, along with describing methods that can be used to 
		assess 
		the dynamic range and quantitative accuracy of qPCR. </p>
		<p align="left">The <a href="lre_analyzer_intro.html">LRE Analyzer 
		Introduction</a> page provides a general overview of how the program 
		functions. It is also recommended that the demonstration database files 
		be opened in order to provide an introduction to LRE using high 
		quality data sets. It is further recommended that the
		<a href="implementing_lre_assays.html">Implementing LRE-based Assays</a> 
		section be consulted before attempting to apply LRE analysis to your own 
		data sets.</p>
		<p align="left">The <a href="../data_import/data_import_overview.html">
		Data Import</a> section provides instructions about how to import data 
		from various software packages, along with the ability to manually 
		import data. </p>

			<h1 class="auto-style1">Options for Adjusting LRE Analysis</h1>
			<p>Two options are available for adjusting how the LRE analysis is 
			conducted.</p>
			<p>The first addresses the propensity of Qiagen QuantiTect enzyme 
			formulation to generate overestimations of amplification efficiency. 
			Although the underlying mechanism is unknown,
			<a href="high_emax.html">fixing Emax to 100%</a> has been found to 
			be effective in reducing the biases caused by this kinetic aberrancy. 
			This section also provides an example of how limiting dilution assay 
			(LDA) can be used to independently assess quantitative accuracy. </p>
			<p>The second, referred to as
			<a href="fmax_normalization.htm">Fmax normalization</a>, addresses variances in 
			instrument optics, the most 
			prominent being 
			well-to-well differences in the fluorescence scale. This section 
			also provides important perspectives into how the optics of an assay 
			impact LRE quantification. </p>

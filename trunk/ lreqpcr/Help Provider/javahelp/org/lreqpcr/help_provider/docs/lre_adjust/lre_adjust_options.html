			<p>Two options are available for adjusting how the LRE analysis is 
			conducted.</p>
			<p>The first is the propensity of Qiagen QuantiTect enzyme 
			formulation to generate overestimations of amplification efficiency. 
			Although the underlying mechanism is unknown,
			<a href="high_emax.html">fixing Emax to 100%</a> has been found to 
			be effective in reducing the biases caused by this kinetic aberrancy.</p>
			<p>The second addresses variances in fluorescence 
			signal intensity, the most 
			prominent being 
			well-to-well differences in the fluorescence scale generated by an 
			instrument&#39;s optical system, and is referred to as

			<h1 class="auto-style1">Options for Adjusting LRE Analysis</h1>
			<p>Two options are available for adjusting how the LRE analysis is 
			conducted. Both involve normalization that compensates for two 
			potential aberrancies that can impact quantitative accuracy. </p>
			<p>The first addresses the propensity of Qiagen Quantitect enzyme 
			formulation to generate overestimations of amplification efficiency 
			by fixing Emax to 100%, and is referred to as
			<a href="high_emax.html">Emax Normalization</a>.</p>
			<p>The second addresses qPCR instrument variance in fluorescence 
			signal calibration, which can generate quantitative errors due to 
			well-to-well differences in the fluorescence units generated by the 
			instrument's optical system, and is referred to as
			<a href="fmax_normalization.htm">Fmax normalization</a>.</p>

		<p>One of the distinctive aspects of LRE is the ability to implement 
		various quality control methodologies. These encompass fundamental 
		issues of optical precision and monitoring of assay performance, to 
		verification of quantitative accuracy and anomalies that occur with 
		target quantities below ten molecules, to kinetic anomalies produced by 
		some enzyme formulations, amplicons and samples. </p>
		<p>Although as a whole such issues may appear to increase the complexity 
		of conducting qPCR, in practice these methodologies can provide an 
		unprecedented level of insight that is difficult, if not impossible to 
		achieve with conventional methods. </p>

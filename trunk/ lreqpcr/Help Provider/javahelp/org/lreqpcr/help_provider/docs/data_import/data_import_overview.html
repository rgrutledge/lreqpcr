      <p>In this version of the LRE analyzer, MS Excel is used to import data, 
		which for most software packages requires manual formatting of the data. 
		Another requirement is to identify both the amplicon and sample used to 
		generate each profile. Unfortunately, some software packages only 
		provide well labels, requiring that the name of the amplicon and sample 
		be provided together within the well label.
  	<p>Note also that during data import, the program will ask whether the 
	majority of the targets are single stranded. If there is a mix of single and 
	double standard targets, it will be necessary to manually adjust the target 
	strandedness after data import. </p>
		<p>Data can also be manually imported using Excel templates for sample 
		and calibration profiles.</p>

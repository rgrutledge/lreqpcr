		<h2 align="left">Profile Data Export</h2>
		<p align="left">Profile data export is accomplished using MS Excel in which data 
		is organized in a type-specific manor, sorted by Run, 
		Amplicon or Sample, which are exported into individual work sheets. 
		Within the explorer panel, profiles data can be exported by run using 
		the export buttons next to the toolbar by first selecting the runs to be 
		exported: </p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/run_export1.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">
		Note that multiple items can be exported by multiple selection using the 
		shift or ctrl key in combination with the mouse button. Ctrl-A can also 
		be used to select all of the items within a window. A dialog will then 
		ask for an export file name and location, followed by opening the 
		created Excel workbook in which each run&#39;s data is placed into an 
		individual worksheet.</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/run_export2.gif" width="786" height="366"></p>
		<p align="left">While this format is similar to conventional data export 
		formats, a more functional format is to sort by either amplicon or 
		sample using the sorting panels. This allows data generated across 
		multiple runs to be grouped together. Similar to run data export, each 
		sort panel provides export buttons:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amp_sort2.gif" width="416" height="303"></p>
		<p align="left">Again a dialog will ask for an export file name and 
		location, followed by opening the created Excel workbook in which data 
		from each amplicon or sample is placed into an individual worksheet.</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amp_sort1.gif" width="814" height="295"></p>
		<h2 align="left"><b><a name="Amplicon_Export">Amplicon Import/Export</a></b></h2>
		<p align="left">Import/export of amplicon data is provided under the &quot;Amplicon 
		Tool&quot; 
		menu item:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amplicon_tools.jpg" width="275" height="98"></p>
		<p align="left">Amplicon data can be imported using an Excel template. 
		Selecting the &quot;Amplicon Import Template&quot; will prompt you for a location 
		and name of the template, which should then trigger the template to be 
		automatically opened in MS Excel. Once data has been entered and the 
		file saved, the data can be imported by selecting &quot;Amplicon Import&quot;. </p>
		<p align="left">Selecting the &quot;Amplicon Export&quot; will prompt for a file 
		name and location for the Excel workbook, which should then 
		automatically open, presenting all of the amplicon data contained within 
		the open amplicon database in the following format:</p>

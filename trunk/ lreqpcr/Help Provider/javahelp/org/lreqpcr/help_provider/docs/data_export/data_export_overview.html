		<p align="left">All data export is accomplished using MS Excel, 
		organized in a type-specific manor such that data is sorted by Run, 
		Amplicon or Sample and exported into individual work sheets. Amplicon 
		import/export functionality is provided within the Menu.</p>

		<p align="left">Data export is primarily accomplished using the export 
		buttons present on each of the explorer windows. These generate an 
		excel workbook containing the selected data. An exception is export and 
		import of amplicon data, which is provided under a menu item called 
		&quot;Amplicon Tools&quot; (see below).&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">Profile data, either Average Profiles or&nbsp; is exported by first selecting parent 
		object such as a run , amplicon or sample, and pressing the export 
		button. Note that multiple items can be exported by multiple selection 
		using the shift or ctrl key in combination with the mouse button. Ctrl-A 
		can also be used to select all of the items within a window. </p>
		<p align="left">The profiles associated with each item (e.g. a run) is 
		placed into an individual worksheet. An exception are average calibration 
		profiles, which are listed together on a single worksheet.</p>

		<p align="left">Amplicon data can be imported using an Excel template. 
		Selecting the &quot;Amplicon Import Template&quot; will prompt you for a location 
		and name of the template, which should then trigger the template to be 
		automatically opened in MS Excel. Once data has been entered and the 
		file saved, the data can be imported by selecting &quot;Amplicon Import&quot;. </p>
		<p align="left">Selecting the &quot;Amplicon Export&quot; will prompt for a file 
		name and location for the Excel workbook, which should then 
		automatically open, presenting all of the amplicon data contained within 
		the open amplicon database in the following format:</p>

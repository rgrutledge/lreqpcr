		<h2 align="left">Profile Data Export</h2>
		<p align="left">Profile data export is accomplished using MS Excel in which data 
		is sorted by run, 
		amplicon or sample, each individually&nbsp; exported into separate work sheets. 
		Within the explorer panel, profiles data can be exported by run using 
		the export buttons next to the toolbar by first selecting the elements to be 
		exported, which in this example are runs: </p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/run_export1.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">
		Note that multiple items can be exported by multiple selection using the 
		shift or ctrl key in combination with the mouse button. Ctrl-A can also 
		be used to select all of the items within a window. A dialog will then 
		ask for a file name and location, which is then automatically opened in Excel. 
		In this example, two worksheets were created, each listing profiles 
		contained within their respective runs:.</p>

		<p align="left">While this format is typical of the data export 
		formats generated by qPCR instruments, a more functional format is to sort by either amplicon or 
		sample using the sorting panels. This allows data generated across 
		multiple runs to be grouped together. Similar to run data export, each 
		sort panel provides export buttons:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amp_sort2.gif" width="416" height="303"></p>
		<p align="left">Again a dialog will ask for a file name and 
		location, which is then automatically opened in Excel, with individual workbooks 
		listing the profiles generated by each amplicon or sample.</p>

		<img border="0" src="images/amp_sort1.gif" width="814" height="295"></p>
		<h2 align="left"><b><a name="Amplicon_Export">Amplicon Import/Export</a></b></h2>
		<p align="left">Import/export of amplicon data is provided under the &quot;Amplicon 
		Tools&quot; 
		menu item:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amplicon_tools.jpg" width="275" height="98"></p>
		<p align="left">Amplicon data can be imported using an Excel template. 
		Selecting the &quot;Amplicon Import Template&quot; will prompt you for a 
		name and location of the template, which is then 
		automatically opened in Excel. Once data has been entered and the 
		file saved, the data can be imported by selecting &quot;Amplicon Import&quot;. </p>
		<p align="left">Selecting the &quot;Amplicon Export&quot; will prompt for a 
		name and location for the Excel workbook, which is then 
		automatically opened, presenting all of the amplicon data contained within 
		the amplicon database:</p>

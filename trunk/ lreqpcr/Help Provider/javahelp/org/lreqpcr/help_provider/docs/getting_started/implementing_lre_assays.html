		<p align="left"><b>Maximizing optical precision</b></p>
		<p align="left">An important issue for effective implementation LRE is 
		maximizing the precision of the fluorescence readings. As discussed in 
		the <a href="../quality_control/optical_precision_overview.html">optical 
		precision</a> overview, the efficacy of LRE is dependent on generating a 
		high level of optical precision. </p>
		<p align="left"><b>Some enzyme formulations produce anomalous 
		amplification kinetics</b></p>
		<p align="left">As described in the
		<a href="../issues/known_issues_overview.html">trouble shooting</a>
		section, some commercially enzyme formulations have been found to 
		produce extensive &quot;profile arcing&quot;, which does not conform well to the 
		LRE model. Enzyme formations that have been found to be effective for 
		LRE analysis include Qiagen QuantiTect, Agilent Brilliant II, and 
		Invitrogen Platinum SYBR, although many others are likely to also be 
		effective.</p>
		<p align="left">It should also be noted that although extensive testing 
		has shown SYBR Green I to be effective for LRE-based absolute 
		quantification, other detection chemistries many not be. </p>
		<p align="left"><b>Conducting performance benchmarks</b></p>
		<p align="left">One of the most effective methods for testing the 
		performance of an assay and/or instrument is to run a standard optical 
		calibration reaction set, which is normally used for optical 
		calibration. As described in the
		<a href="../quality_control/developing_performance_benchmarks.html">
		developing performance benchmarks</a> section, this exploits the 
		universal nature of lambda gDNA to provide a foundation from which to 
		assess the general performance of an assay.</p>
		<p><b>Assessing quantitative accuracy</b></p>
		<p>As is true for any quantitative technology, assessing quantitative 
		accuracy should be an important objective during implementation of a new 
		qPCR assay. As discussed in the
		<a href="../quality_control/quality_control.html">quality 
		control section</a>, Poisson distribution allows absolute quantification 
		to be conducted independent of the kinetic 
		and optical parameters upon which real-time PCR is based. Referred to 
		here as &quot;<a href="../quantitative_accuracy/lda_overview.html">limited 
		dilution assay</a>&quot;, the analysis simply requires that the target be 
		diluted to about 0.7 molecules per aliquot and to conduct 16-32 replicate 
		amplification reactions. Target quantity is determined by the number of 
		nil replicate reactions resulting from aliquots that do not contain a 
		target molecule (i.e. 0 N aliquots). </p>
      	<p>In practice LDA has proven to be an invaluable tool not only for 
		assessing the quantitative accuracy of an assay, but as well for 
		assessing potential sources of quantitative error, by providing an 
		independent determination of target quantity. It is thus recommended 
		that implementation an LRE-based assay include LDA quantification of at 
		least one representative sample. </p>

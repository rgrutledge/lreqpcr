        <h1 align="center">Implementing LRE-based Assays</h1>
		<p align="left"><b>LRE was developed for SYBR Green I-based assays<br>
		</b>It is important to note that although LRE qPCR has been found to be 
		effective for a number of enzyme formulations that use SYBR Green I 
		detection, 
		other fluorescence chemistries, particularly probed-based assays, may 
		not be effective. </p>
		<p align="left"><b>Some enzyme formulations produce anomalous 
		amplification kinetics<br>
		</b>As described in the
		<a href="../issues/profile_arcing.html">profile arcing section</a>
		section, some enzyme formulations, such as ABI&#39;s AmpliTaq Gold, have been found to 
		produce extensive &quot;profile arcing&quot;, which does not conform 
		well to the 
		LRE model. Enzyme formations that have been found to be effective for 
		LRE analysis include Qiagen QuantiTect, Agilent Brilliant II, and 
		Invitrogen Platinum SYBR, although many other SYBR Green I-based 
		formulations are also likely to be 
		effective.</p>
		<p align="left"><b>Maximizing optical precision<br>
		</b>An important issue for effective implementation of LRE is 
		maximizing the precision of the fluorescence readings, as is discussed in 
		the <a href="../quality_control/optical_precision_overview.html">optical 
		precision</a> overview. </p>
		<p align="left"><b>Conducting performance benchmarks<br>
		</b>One of the most effective methods for testing the 
		performance of an assay and/or instrument is to run a standard optical 
		calibration reaction set, which is normally used for optical 
		calibration. As described in the
		<a href="../quality_control/developing_performance_benchmarks.html">
		developing performance benchmarks</a> section, which describe how the 
		universal nature of lambda gDNA can provide a foundation from which to 
		assess the general performance of an assay.</p>
		<p><b>Assessing quantitative accuracy<br>
		</b>As is true for any quantitative technology, assessing quantitative 
		accuracy should be an important objective during implementation of a new 
		qPCR assay. As discussed in the
		<a href="../quality_control/quality_control.html">quality 
		control section</a>, Poisson distribution allows absolute quantification 
		to be conducted independent of the kinetic 
		and optical parameters upon which real-time PCR is based. Referred to 
		as &quot;<a href="../quantitative_accuracy/lda_overview.html">limited 
		dilution assay</a>&quot;, the analysis simply requires that the target be 
		diluted to about 0.7 molecules per aliquot and to conduct 16-32 replicate 
		amplification reactions. Target quantity is then determined from the number of 
		nil replicate reactions resulting from aliquots that do not contain a 
		target molecule (i.e. 0 N aliquots). </p>
      	<p>In practice LDA has proven to be an invaluable tool not only for 
		assessing the quantitative accuracy of an assay, but as well for 
		assessing potential sources of quantitative error, by providing an 
		independent determination of target quantity. It is thus recommended 
		that implementation an LRE-based assay include LDA quantification of at 
		least one representative sample. </p>

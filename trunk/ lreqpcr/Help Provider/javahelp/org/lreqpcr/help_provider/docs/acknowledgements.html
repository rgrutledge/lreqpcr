		<p align="left">The LRE Analyzer was developed using NetBeans IDE that 
		in combination with the NetBeans platform provided the infrastructure 
		required for a fully featured desktop program: netbeans.org</p>
		<p align="left">Several open source APIs were also essential:</p>
		<p align="left">Versant db4objects (version 7.4.106.13438) provides all 
		of the database functions, which is an object-orientated database that 
		eliminates the need for database administration: db4o.com</p>
		<p align="left">Andy Khan&#39;s JExcel provides data import and export 
		functions: jexcelapi.sourceforge.net</p>
		<p align="left">Peter Abeles&#39;s Efficient Java Matrix Library (EJML) 
		provides the nonlinear regression analysis capabilities via his 
		implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm: code.google.com/p/efficient-java-matrix-library/wiki/LevenbergMarquardtExample</p>
		<p align="left">The many stimulating conversations with Joel 
		Tellinghuisen were instrumental in initiating the application of 
		nonlinear regression analysis to LRE qPCR. </p>

<h1 align="center">Fmax Normalization</h1>

<p>Fmax normalization is applied by selecting the checkbox (&quot;Fmax Normalize&quot;) 
located just above the explorer panel tree, while deselecting the checkbox removes 
Fmax normalization. Note also that Fmax normalization is applied to all runs 
contained within the database.</p>
<p>Fmax normalization corrects for well-to-well differences in fluorescence 
calibration, that is, differences in the fluorescent scale assigned by the 
instrument to each individual well. Although the impact of such variance generally 
small , the simplistic natural of Fmax normalization makes it an attractive 
option for potentially increasing the accuracy of LRE quantification, which can 
be significant in some cases. As discussed below, analysis of a run's average 
Fmax also introduces an additional quality control component that is available 
whether Fmax normalization is implemented or not. </p>
<p>So, how can&nbsp;of fluorescence calibration be analyzed, and how does it 
impact quantitative accuracy? Due to the fact that LRE determines target quantity expressed fluorescence 
units, quantitative accuracy is directly dependent on the optical precision of 
the qPCR instrument. Extensive application of optical calibration using lambda gDNA has 
historically indicated that for most modern qPCR instruments, this is not a major 
concern. However, closer examination has revealed that significant well-to-well 
differences in fluorescent scale can occur, despite the high levels of 
optical precision that these instruments can generate. </p>
<p>Although still under investigation, 
such variances have been found to generate quantitative errors in the range of 0.5- to 2.0-fold, 
based on the quantitative differences observed between identical samples 
amplified within different wells. Further examination revealed that these 
quantitative differences correlate directly to the height of each respective 
profile. In the absence of any other factor (see below), differences in profile 
height directly reflects differences in the fluorescence units assigned by the 
instrument to each respective well (referred to as fluorescence calibration). </p>
<p class="auto-style3">Need to provide a graphic illustrating this.</p>
<p>Under the LRE model, quantifying profile height is an integral part of 
target quantification. Defined as the maximal fluorescence, Fmax, 
this provides a quantitative approach to addressing variances in fluorescence 
calibration, in addition to providing a run-to-run quality control component. 
This is accomplished by first determining the average Fmax across all 
wells within each run. The key aspect here, is that this provides a reference to 
which the Fmax generated by individual wells can be compared. </p>
<p>For example, if a profile generates a Fmax that is 50% higher than the 
average Fmax , it will generate ~50% overestimation of target 
quantity (i.e. the fluorescence units are 50% greater than the average). When 
Fmax normalization is applied, this bias is corrected 
by simply lowering the predicted target quantity by 50%. If the profile height 
is smaller than the average, the target quantity is similarly increased in 
relation to the average Fmax . </p>
<p>&nbsp;The average F<sub>max</sub> also provides a simple method for assessing 
the level of fluorescence unit variation within a run, as reflected by the coefficient of&nbsp; 
variation (CV = standard deviation / average X 100%). Typically, a run generates 
a Fmax CV in the range of 10-15%, which reflects the level of quantitative 
variance that would be generated (fluorescence units have a linear scale), 
assuming the absence of other factors. It is here, however, that another 
aspect must be considered, which is that differences in amplification efficiency 
(Emax) also impacts

<p class="auto-style1"><a href="../lre_overview/lre_introduction.html">
<img alt="" class="auto-style2" height="51" src="../lre_overview/images/Fmax_equation.gif" width="103"></a></p>
<p>A necessary assumption of Fmax normalization, as it is applied in this 
version of the LRE Analyzer, is that amplification efficiency is equal, or at 
least similar, for all profiles within a run. <span class="auto-style3">Maybe it 
would be best to conduct analysis of the lambda runs in relation to variance in 
Emax, and of a typical run(s) to better determine that actual variance in Emax 
across different amplicons, before completing this synopsis. </span> </p>
<p>The average Fmax also allows run-to-run differences in fluorescence scale to 
be assessed, by comparing their respective average Fmax values. The average Fmax across all runs contained within a database 
is presented in the top node within the profile explorer panel, along with 
the corresponding CV. Although these differences are generally small (&lt;10%), 
this does allow any aberrations in the optical characteristic of a run to be easily 
identified. This could be produced, for example, by technical errors in reaction 
setup or aberrations in an instrument's optical system. Although such situations 
are expected to be rare, it does provide another quality control component that 
describes the optical characteristics of individual runs. </p>

<h1 align="center">F<sub>max</sub> Normalization</h1>

<p>Fmax normalization corrects for well-to-well differences in the fluorescence 
scale generated by the instrument's optical system. Because LRE quantification 
is founded upon determining target quantity expressed in fluorescence units, any 
variance in the fluorescence units produced by individual wells generates a 
corresponding error in target quantification, albeit in a linear fashion. </p>
<p>The LRE Analyzer provides an option to correct for such variances by 
adjusting target quantities relative to the average Fmax generated by all of the 
profiles within a run. This type of internal calibration also provides a quality 
control methodology for assessing both intra- and inter-run variances in 
fluorescence intensity, based on the Fmax coefficient of variance and the 
average Fmax generated by individual runs, respectively, as provided within the 
run label.</p>
<p align="center">

<p>Fmax normalization is applied by selecting the &quot;Fmax Normalize&quot; checkbox 
located just above the explorer panel tree, while deselecting the checkbox 
removes Fmax normalization. An asterisk (*) is also added to the profile 
label to indicate that Fmax normalization has been applied. </p>

<p align="left">Although such well-to-well differences are generally small, this 
is an extreme example in which a badly calibrated instrument generated up to 
1-fold difference in target quantity for identical amplification reactions (1876 
lambda genomes + CAL1):</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="left">The Fc plot within the profile editor panel presents the average 
Fmax as a line, to which individual profiles can be compared. These are examples 
of two extreme profiles that generated close to 1-fold differences in target 
quantity:</p>

<img border="0" src="Fmax_normzn4.GIF" width="359" height="315"></p>
<p>Also worthy of note is that the C<sub>1/2</sub> values are nearly identical 
(as is the case for all the other profiles in this run), whereas the 
corresponding Cq values difference by 1.0 cycle. Although still under investigation, 
in the absence of other factors (see below), these differences in profile 
height appear to reflect differences in the fluorescence scale generated by the 
instrument's optical system. </p>
<p>Fmax normalization compares a profile's Fmax to the run's average Fmax and adjusts the predicted target 
quantity based on their difference. For example, if a profile generates a Fmax that is 50% higher than the 
average Fmax, it will generate a 50% overestimation of target 
quantity. Fmax normalization corrects the bias by simply lowering the predicted target quantity by 50%. If the profile height 
is lower than the average, the target quantity is similarly increased:</p>
<p><b>Some important qualifications</b><br>
Importantly, this approach assumes the absence of other factors impacting 
profile height, which is 
not necessarily the case. For example, differences in amplification efficiency 
(Emax) also impacts Fmax in a linear fashion

<img alt="" class="auto-style2" height="51" src="../lre_overview/images/Fmax_equation.gif" width="103"></a></p>
<p>Thus, a necessary assumption of Fmax normalization as it is applied in this 
version of the LRE Analyzer, is that amplification efficiency is equal, or at 
least similar, for all profiles within a run. </p>
<p>A second assumption is that all 
amplicons generate similar fluorescence intensities (FU/bp), which, as based on previous 
work <a href="../lre_overview/lre_literature.html">(Rutledge and Stewart 2010)</a>, 
appears to be generally valid. However, implementing an average run Fmax has 
revealed exceptions to this assumption. For example, the SAND F1R1 amplicon that 
is included in the demonstration experiment database, for unknown reasons, 
consistently generates Fmax values that are about 25% lower than the average 
Fmax. Interesting, it could be argued that Fmax normalization corrects for such 
amplicon-specific differences in fluorescence intensity, although this has not 
been investigated.</p>

<p>Fmax normalization is applied by selecting the &quot;Fmax Normalize&quot; checkbox 
located just above the explorer panel tree, while deselecting the checkbox 
removes Fmax normalization. In addition, an asterisk (*) is added to the profile 
label to indicate that Fmax normalization has been applied. </p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/checkbox.gif"></p>
<p>Fmax normalization was introduced primarily to correct for well-to-well differences in fluorescence 
scale generated by the 
instrument's optical system. Although such variances are generally 
small, the simple natural of Fmax normalization provides an attractive 
option for potentially increasing the accuracy of LRE quantification. As 
discussed below, analysis of a run's average Fmax also introduces an additional 
quality control component.</p>
<p>Because LRE determines target quantity expressed in fluorescence 
units, the quantitative accuracy of LRE is directly dependent on the optical 
precision of the qPCR instrument. In particular, LRE quantification assumes that 
all wells generate identical 
fluorescence signal intensities. However, as illustrated below, 
large differences in profile height brings this assumption into question.</p>
<p>Under the LRE model, quantifying profile height is an integral part of 
target quantification. Defined as the maximal fluorescence or Fmax, LRE analysis provides a quantitative 
foundation for addressing differences in fluorescence 
scale. 
This is accomplished by first determining the average Fmax across all 
wells within each run. This provides a reference point to 
which the Fmax generated by an individual well can be compared. </p>
<p align="left">The profiles shown below were generated by amplifying 100 fg of lambda gDNA 
(1,876 genomes) using the 
CAL1 amplicon, which produced an average Fmax of 4,290,000. However, as 
illustrated by the instrument's amplification plot, Fmax ranged from 3,570,000 to 6,370,000:</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="left">Importantly, Fmax is linearly related to scale used to express  
target quantity, which for these two extreme examples generate close to a one 
fold difference in predicted target quantity:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/well_e5.gif" width="354" height="312"></p>
<p>Also worthy of note is that the C<sub>1/2</sub> values are nearly identical 
(as is the case for all the other profiles in this run), whereas the 
corresponding Cq values difference by 1.0 cycles. Although still under investigation, 
in the absence of other factors (see below), these differences in profile 
height appear to reflect differences in the fluorescence scale generated by the 
instrument's optical system. </p>
<p>Fmax normalization utilizes a profile's Fmax to adjust the predicted target 
quantity based on the relative difference to the run's average Fmax. For example, if a profile generates a Fmax that is 50% higher than the 
average Fmax , it will generate a 50% overestimation of target 
quantity. Fmax normalization corrects the bias by simply lowering the predicted target quantity by 50%. If the profile height 
is smaller than the average, the target quantity is similarly increased:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/well_e5_nrmd.gif" width="355" height="312"></p>
<p>The average Fmax also provides a simple method for assessing 
the variance of fluorescence scale across all wells within a run, as 
indicated by the coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation / 
average X100%). In addition, the average Fmax allows run-to-run differences in 
fluorescence scale to be assessed, by comparing their respective average Fmax 
values:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/av_run_fmax.gif" width="439" height="124"></p>
<p>Examining these three lambda runs reveals that despite large differences in 
well-to-well Fmax values, the overall variance is relatively moderate (±11% for 
all three runs in this example). Furthermore, the ±1.3% run-to-run variance 
generated here 
is indicative of the high level of optical precision generated by this 
instrument (ABI 7500), as was also evident from the analysis described in the
<a href="../quality_control/optical_precision_overview.html">Optical Precision</a> 
section. This suggests that well-to-well differences are not necessarily due to 
loss of optical precision, but are rather more likely related to calibration, that is, 
differences in fluorescence scale assigned to an individual well. </p>
<p>Although these 
run-to-run variances have been found to be generally small, examining the 
average Fmax does allow any aberrations in the optics of an individual 
run to be identified. This could be produced, for example, by technical 
errors in reaction setup or aberrations in an instrument's optical system during 
a run. Although such situations are expected to be rare, this approach does 
provide an additional quality control element. </p>
<p><b>Some important qualifications</b><br>
Importantly, this approach assumes the absence of other factors impacting 
profile height, which is 
not necessarily the case. For example, differences in amplification efficiency 
(Emax) also impacts Fmax in a linear fashion
<a href="../lre_overview/lre_literature.html">(Rutledge and Stewart 2010)</a>. </p>
<p class="auto-style1"><a href="../lre_overview/lre_introduction.html">
<img alt="" class="auto-style2" height="51" src="../lre_overview/images/Fmax_equation.gif" width="103"></a></p>
<p>Thus, a necessary assumption of Fmax normalization, as it is applied in this 
version of the LRE Analyzer, is that amplification efficiency is equal, or at 
least similar, for all profiles within a run. </p>
<p>A second assumption is that all 
amplicons generate similar fluorescence intensities (FU/bp), which, as based on previous 
work <a href="../lre_overview/lre_literature.html">(Rutledge and Stewart 2010)</a>, appears to be generally 
valid. 
However, implementing the average Fmax has revealed exceptions to this 
assumption. For example, the SAND F1R1 amplicon that is included in the 
demonstration experiment database, for unknown reasons, consistently generates 
Fmax values that are about 25% lower than the average Fmax. However, it is also 
important to note that in addition to being small, such 
systemic biases are repeatable, and as such, relative differences in 
target quantity are not impacted. </p>

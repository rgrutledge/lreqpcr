<h1 align="center">F<sub>max</sub> Normalization</h1>

<p>Fmax normalization is applied by selecting the &quot;Fmax Normalize&quot; checkbox 
located just above the explorer panel tree, while deselecting the checkbox 
removes Fmax normalization. In addition, an asterisk (*) is added to the profile 
label to indicate that Fmax formalization has been applied. </p>
<p>Fmax normalization was introduced primarily as an attempt to correct for well-to-well differences in fluorescence 
scale generated by the 
instrument's optical system. Although such variances are generally 
small , the simplistic natural of Fmax normalization provides an attractive 
option for potentially increasing the accuracy of LRE quantification. As 
discussed below, analysis of a run's average Fmax also introduces an additional 
quality control component.</p>
<p>Because target quantity is derived from the fluorescence 
readings, the quantitative accuracy of LRE is directly dependent on the optical 
precision of the qPCR instrument. In particular, LRE quantification assumes that 
all wells have identical optical characteristics. However, as illustrated below, 
large variations in profile height brings this assumption into question.</p>
<p align="left">Identical quantities of lambda gDNA were amplified using the 
CAL1 amplicon, which generated an average Fmax of 4,290,000. Importantly, these 
differences in profile height are linearly related to differences in predicted 
target quantity, and is a result of variances in the optics of each well. In this case, the two most 
extreme profiles generate close to a two fold difference in predicted target 
quantity (high vs. low = 2,866 vs. 1,537; actual quantity = 1,876 molecules).</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="fmax_n1.jpg"></p>
<p>Although still under investigation, 
in the absence of other factors (see below), differences in profile 
height directly reflect differences in the fluorescence units assigned by the instrument's optical system 
to each respective well, referred to here as 
fluorescence calibration.</p>
<p>Under the LRE model, quantifying profile height is an integral part of 
target quantification. Defined as the maximal fluorescence, Fmax, 
this provides a quantitative approach to addressing variances in fluorescence 
calibration, in addition to providing a run-to-run quality control component. 
This is accomplished by first determining the average Fmax across all 
wells within each run. The key aspect here, is that this provides a reference to 
which the Fmax generated by individual wells can be compared. </p>
<p>For example, if a profile generates a Fmax that is 50% higher than the 
average Fmax , it will generate ~50% overestimation of target 
quantity (i.e. the fluorescence units are 50% greater than the average). When 
Fmax normalization is applied, this bias is corrected 
by simply lowering the predicted target quantity by 50%. If the profile height 
is smaller than the average, the target quantity is similarly increased in 
relation to the average Fmax . </p>
<p>The average Fmax also provides a simple method for assessing 
the level of fluorescence unit variation within a run, as reflected by the coefficient of&nbsp; 
variation (CV = standard deviation / average X100%). Typically, a run generates 
a Fmax CV in the range of ±15%, which reflects the general level of quantitative 
variance that would be generated (fluorescence units have a linear scale and 
impact target quantity in a linear fashion). Importantly, this assumes the absence of other factors. It is here, however, that another 
aspect must be considered, which is that differences in amplification efficiency 
(Emax) also impacts
Fmax <a href="../lre_overview/lre_literature.html">(Rutledge and Stewart 2010)</a>. </p>
<p class="auto-style1"><a href="../lre_overview/lre_introduction.html">
<img alt="" class="auto-style2" height="51" src="../lre_overview/images/Fmax_equation.gif" width="103"></a></p>
<p>A necessary assumption of Fmax normalization, as it is applied in this 
version of the LRE Analyzer, is that amplification efficiency is equal, or at 
least similar, for all profiles within a run. A second assumption is that all 
amplicons generate similar fluorescence intensities, which based on previous 
work <a href="../lre_overview/lre_literature.html">(Rutledge and Stewart 2010)</a>, appears to be generally correct. 
However, more work is required to better understand this phenomenon. For 
example, the SAND F1R1 amplicon that is included in the demonstration experiment 
database, consistently generates Fmax values that are about 25% lower that the 
average Fmax, the reason for which is currently undetermined.</p>
<p>Finally, the average Fmax also allows run-to-run differences in fluorescence scale to 
be assessed, by comparing their respective average Fmax values. The average Fmax across all runs contained within a database, 
along with the corresponding CV, is presented as a hint within the top node within the profile explorer panel 
(made visible by hovering the mouse over the node), . Although these differences are generally small (&lt;5%), 
this does allow any aberrations in the optical characteristic of an individual run to be easily 
identified. This could be produced, for example, by technical errors in reaction 
setup or aberrations in an instrument's optical system. Although such situations 
are expected to be rare, it does provide quality control component that 
describes the optical characteristics of individual runs, along the that of 
individual wells as discussed above. </p>

<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial">Manual sample profile import using an Excel template</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">Manual data import assumes that each workbook encompasses 
an entire run. However, a run can still be split into&nbsp; across multiple 
Excel workbooks, but the program will display the data within each workbook 
dataset as an individual run. In practice, this is not a problem, as the
<a href="../sorting_panel/sorting_panel_overview.html">sorting panel</a> allows 
data across multiple runs to be&nbsp; exported as a single unit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note that Excel 2003 has a limit of 182 Fc datasets and 
that the template does not allow Ct and Ft values to be imported; well position and amplicon Tm 
are also not imported.&nbsp; Also note that calibration profiles must be 
imported separately using the <a href="calbnprofile_template_import.html">calibration 
profile template</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To open an empty Excel template, go to the Import menu and 
select &quot;Create a Sample Import Template&quot;. A file dialog box will 
appear asking for a name and a location for the resulting Excel file. Once a 
file has be designated, Excel should automatically 
open to display the sample import template:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/templa1.gif"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Enter the Run date in C1, if the default date is not 
correct, along with a Run name. Note that although 
the Run date and F<sub>C</sub> readings cannot be changed following data import, all of the other values can be 
manually edited on within the program. Note also that if the amplicon 
size is left blank, the program will attempt to retrieve the amplicon size from 
the amplicon database, assuming one is open. If not, the amplicon size will be 
set to zero. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Each profile F<sub>C</sub> dataset is entered vertically 
starting at C10, along with the amplicon name, amplicon size and sample name in 
rows 4-6 respectively for each profile. These should be the raw fluorescence readings 
(i.e. not background subtracted), in order to avoid the instrument's software 
from modifying the fluorescence readings, which is a known issue for the 
MX3000P. Nevertheless, the program will accept background subtracted F<sub>C</sub> datasets if this is 
deemed necessary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The default strandedness of the target is single stranded. 
This can be changed to double stranded by putting &quot;Yes&quot; in row 7. If left blank 
the default single stranded will be applied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">SAVE THE FILE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To initiate data import go to the Import menu and select 
&quot;Manually Import Sample Profiles&quot;.</font></p>

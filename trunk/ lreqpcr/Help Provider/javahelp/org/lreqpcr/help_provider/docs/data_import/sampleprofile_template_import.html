<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial">Manual sample profile import using an Excel template</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">Manual data import assumes that each workbook is 
representative of a single run. However, a run can still be split across multiple 
Excel workbooks. However, the program will display each workbook 
dataset as an individual run. In practice, this is not a problem, as the
<a href="../sorting_panel/sorting_panel_overview.html">sorting panel</a> allows 
data across multiple runs to be&nbsp; exported as a single unit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note that Excel 2003 has a limit of 182 Fc datasets and 
that the template does not allow Ct and Ft values to be imported.&nbsp; Also note that calibration profiles must be 
imported separately using the <a href="calbnprofile_template_import.html">calibration 
profile template</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To open an empty Excel sample template, go to the Import /&nbsp; 
Manual Data Entry / Create a Sample Import Template. A file dialog box will 
appear asking for a name and a location for the resulting Excel file. Once a 
file has be designated, Excel should automatically 
open to display an empty sample import template. Here is an example taken from 
the demonstration sample database::</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/sample_template.gif" width="289" height="249"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Enter the Run date in C1, if the default date is not 
correct, along with a Run name. Note that although 
the Run date and F<sub>C</sub> readings cannot be changed following data import, all of the other values can be 
manually edited within the program. Note also that if the amplicon 
size is left blank, the program will attempt to retrieve the amplicon size from 
the amplicon database, assuming one is open. If not, the amplicon size will be 
set to zero. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Each profile F<sub>C</sub> dataset is entered vertically 
starting at C10, which should be the raw fluorescence readings 
(i.e. not background subtracted). Nevertheless, the program will accept background subtracted F<sub>C</sub> datasets if this is 
necessary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The default strandedness of the target is single stranded. 
This can be changed to double stranded by putting &quot;Yes&quot; in row 7. If left blank 
the default single stranded will be applied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">SAVE THE FILE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">To initiate data import go to the Import menu and select 
&quot;Manually Import Sample Profiles&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note that Excel workbooks containing the demonstration 
database Fc datasets (included with the demonstration database files) are valid 
import files, and thus provide examples of how these templates function . </font></p>

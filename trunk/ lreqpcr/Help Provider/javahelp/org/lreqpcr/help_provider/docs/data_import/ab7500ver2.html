<p><b><font face="Arial">Plate Setup</font></b><font face="Arial"><br>
It is important that the plate be setup using the target 
and sample assignments provided by the version 2 software, and that these 
correspond to the amplicon and sample names, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;The plate setup also 
provides the ability to designate which wells are standards (i.e. calibration 
profiles) under the &quot;Task&quot; column. It is also important to enter the amount lambda gDNA 
in <b>femtograms</b> into the &quot;Quantity&quot; column for each calibration well. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The program import function is designed to take advantage of all of these features, so it is 
essential that this be done correctly.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Removing ROX normalization</font></b><font face="Arial"><br>
It is important to turn off ROX normalization, which has not been found to increase quantitative accuracy. The menu 
for turning normalization off is located at the bottom of the &quot;Assign Targets 
and Samples&quot; page located within the &quot;Plate Setup&quot; in the Setup menu:</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Export data to an Excel file</font></b><font face="Arial"><br>
Go to &quot;Export&quot; located in the toolbar. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Set data to export to Results and Amplification Data, 
select one file for data export, and select &quot;Open file(s) when export is complete&quot;. 
You may want to change the &quot;Export File Location:&quot; to a more convenient 
location, in that you will later need to select this file for data import. The Excel workbook should then open automatically.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/ab75005.jpg"></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Enter the Run Date</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The only modification required is to re-enter the Run date 
in the Results sheet, located at B4. The run date can be entered in short form, 
e.g. 5sep10, and pressing enter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">SAVE THE FILE...</font></p>

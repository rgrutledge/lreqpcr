      	<p>The demo databases are provided to demonstrate how 
		the LRE Analyzer functions, in addition to providing insights into 
		the capabilities of LRE quantification. These databases were taken from a study investigating the 
		precision of gene expression profiling, 
		in which the reproducibility of 
		reverse transcription and run-to-run variance were assessed. </p>
		<p>Four Arabidopsis reference genes Three runs conducted over a three 
		day period, in which within each of the three replicate RT preparations (i.e. made 
		with an identical RNA sample) using three replicate PCR reactions for 
		each determination. Optical calibration was conducted with both CAL1 and 
		CAL2 using six replicate PCR reactions for each determination. Although 
		only three 
		replicate reactions are normally conducted, increasing to six provides a 
		more in depth insight into the reproducibility of

		calibration</a>.</p>
		<p>The three runs were conducted on an Applied Biosystems 7500 instrument 
		(normal ramping) using QuantiTect in a 10 <font face="Times New Roman">Âµ</font>l 
		reaction volume containing 500 <font face="Times New Roman">n</font>M of 
		primers, in 96 well white plates (ABgene) sealed with MicroAmp film 
		(Applied Biosystems), amplified using a cycling regime of 15&#39; activation 
		at 95 <sup>o</sup>C, followed by 50 cycles of 95 <sup>o</sup>C-10 sec,

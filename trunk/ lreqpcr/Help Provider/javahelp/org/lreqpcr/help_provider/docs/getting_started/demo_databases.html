      	<p>The demo databases are provided to illustrate how 
		the LRE Analyzer functions, in addition to providing insights into 
		the capabilities of absolute quantification. These databases were taken from a study investigating the 
		precision of gene expression profiling, 
		in which the reproducibility of 
		reverse transcription and run-to-run variance were assessed. </p>
		<p>Four Arabidopsis reference genes were quantified within three 
		replicate runs conducted over a three day period, allowing run to run 
		variance to be examined. The three samples (COL1-3) are replicate 
		reverse transcriptase&nbsp; preparations made with an identical RNA sample, 
		allowing the variance of reverse transcription to be examined. Optical calibration was conducted with CAL1 using six replicate PCR reactions for each determination. Although 
		only three 
		replicate reactions are normally conducted, increasing to six provides a 
		more in depth insight into the reproducibility of 
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Optical_Calibration">optical 
		calibration</a>.</p>
		<p>The three runs were conducted on an Applied Biosystems 7500 instrument 
		(normal ramping) using QuantiTect in a 10 <font face="Times New Roman">Âµ</font>l 
		reaction volume containing 500 <font face="Times New Roman">n</font>M of 
		primers, in 96 well white plates (ABgene) sealed with MicroAmp film 
		(Applied Biosystems), amplified using a cycling regime of 15&#39; activation 
		at 95 <sup>o</sup>C, followed by 50 cycles of 95 <sup>o</sup>C-10 sec, 
		65 <sup>o</sup>C-120 sec.</p>

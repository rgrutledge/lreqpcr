		<p>The LRE Analyzer provides two general methods for monitoring assay 
		performance. The first is based on variance generated by optical 
		calibrations conducted over multiple runs. In the example presented below, 
		taken from the demonstration calibration database, CAL1 calibration profiles produced over 3 runs generated an average OCF 
		CV of Â±3.5%:</p>

		<p>Although amplification of a highly purified target such as lambda 
		gDNA would be expected to produce lower run-to-run variance than, for 
		example, of a cDNA target, the average OCF CV has generally been found to be 
		a reliable indicator of assay performance.</p>
		<p>The second method provides an assessment of intra-run variance, based 
		on the repeatability of replicate profiles (i.e. technical replicates). 
		The example shown below is taken from the same dataset presented above, 
		in which six replicate calibration reactions for CAL1 were conducted 
		in each 
		run. Averaging the CVs generated by each 
		replicate set across all runs is presented in the LRE Window Selection Parameters panel, 
		referred to&nbsp; as 
		the &quot;Av Repl CV&quot;:</p>

		<p>Note also that these datasets were generated with the Applied 
		Biosystems 7500, which has been found to generate&nbsp;high levels of 
		read precision. The optical performance of other types of 
		instruments has been found to vary significantly. See the
		<a href="optical_precision_overview.html">optical precision overview</a> 
		for additional details.</p>

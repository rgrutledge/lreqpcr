		<p>The LRE Analyzer provides two general methods for monitoring assay 
		performance. The first is based on run-to-run variance generated by optical 
		calibrations conducted over multiple runs. In the example presented below, calibration profiles 
		(CAL1 and CAL2) 
		produced over 3 runs generated an average OCF CV of Â±14.6%:</p>

		<p>Although amplification of a highly purified target such as lambda 
		gDNA would be expected to produce lower run-to-run variance than, for 
		example, of a cDNA target, the average OCF CV does provide a general 
		indicator of assay performance. </p>
		<p>The second method provides an assessment of intra-run variance, based 
		on the repeatability of replicate profiles (i.e. technical replicates). 
		This example shown below is taken from the same dataset presented above, 
		in which six replicate calibration reactions for both CAL1 and CAL2 were conducted 
		in each 
		run. Averaging the CVs generated by from each 
		replicate set across all runs is presented in the LRE Window Selection Parameters panel, 
		referred to&nbsp; as 
		the &quot;Av Repl CV&quot;:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>Replicate Calibration Profile F<sub>0</sub> CV 
		(CAL1)</b><br>
		<img border="0" src="images/repl_fo_cv.gif" width="256" height="105"></p>
		<p>Unlike the average OCF CV described above, the average replicate CV provides an 
		estimate of the intra-run variance. The same analysis is available for 
		an experiment database, although sample profiles are expected to 
		generate larger CV values due to the fact that it is based on a larger 
		number of amplicons.
		</p>
		<p>While these analyses provide only a limited perspective into assay 
		performance, in practice these have been found to be generally 
		effective in assessing the general performance of an assay. </p>
		<p>Note also that these datasets were generated with the Applied 
		Biosystems 7500, which has been found to generate&nbsp;high levels of 
		read precision. The optical performance of other types of 
		instruments has been found to vary significantly. See the
		<a href="optical_precision_overview.html">optical precision overview</a> 
		for additional details.</p>

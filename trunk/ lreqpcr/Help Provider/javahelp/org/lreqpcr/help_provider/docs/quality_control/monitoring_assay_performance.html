		<p>The LRE Analyzer provides two general methods for monitoring assay 
		performance. The first is based on variance generated by optical 
		calibrations conducted over multiple runs. In the example presented below, calibration profiles 
		(CAL1 and CAL2) 
		produced over 3 runs generated an average OCF CV of Â±15.1%:</p>
		<p align="center"><b>Average OCF CV</b><br>

		<p>Although amplification of a highly purified target such as lambda 
		gDNA would be expected to produce lower run-to-run variance than, for 
		example, of a cDNA target, the average OCF CV does provide a general 
		indicator of assay performance that is generally consistent with level 
		of quantitative accuracy as assessed, e.g., using limiting dilution 
		assays, as is discussed in the
		<a href="../quantitative_accuracy/assessing_accuracy.html">Assessing 
		Quantitative Accuracy</a> section . </p>
		<p>The second method provides an assessment of intra-run variance, based 
		on the repeatability of replicate profiles (i.e. technical replicates). 
		This example shown below is taken from the same dataset presented above, 
		in which six replicate calibration reactions for both CAL1 and CAL2 were conducted 
		in each 
		run. Averaging the CVs generated by from each 
		replicate set across all runs is presented in the LRE Window Selection Parameters panel, 
		referred to&nbsp; as 
		the &quot;Av Repl CV&quot;:</p>

		<p>While these analyses provide only a limited perspective into assay 
		performance, in practice these have been found to be generally 
		effective in assessing the performance of an assay. </p>
		<p>Note also that these datasets were generated with the Applied 
		Biosystems 7500, which has been found to generate&nbsp;high levels of 
		read precision. The optical performance of other types of 
		instruments has been found to vary significantly. See the
		<a href="optical_precision_overview.html">optical precision overview</a> 
		for additional details.</p>

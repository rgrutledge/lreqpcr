		<p>Although it is generally recommended to use an average OCF generated 
		over multiple runs, it is sometimes useful to apply a run-specific OCF. 
		This is accomplished by right clicking on a run, which produces a popup 
		menu, and selecting &quot;Apply Run-specific OCF&quot;: </p>
    	<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/run_specific_ocf1.gif" width="386" height="203"></p>
		<p align="left">This generates a dialog box into which a value can be 
		entered:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/run_specific_ocf2.gif" width="266" height="122">&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p align="left">This value is then presented in the run label to 
		indicate that a run-specific OCF has been applied to the run:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/run_specific_ocf3.gif" width="381" height="185"></p>
		<p align="left">To remove a run-specific OCF, repeat the process and 
		enter zero as the OCF value. </p>

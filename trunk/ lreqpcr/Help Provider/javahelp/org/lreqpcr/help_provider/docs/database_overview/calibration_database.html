		<p>Similar to the <a href="experiment_database.html">Experiment Database</a>, data is stored in a tree-like 
		structure in which calibration profiles are listed under the 
		corresponding <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Reaction_Setup">Reaction Setup</a>. 
		An &quot;Average Calibration Profile&quot; is 
		derived by averaging of the profiles from each of their respective 
		replicate profiles to produce an
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile</a>. </p>
		<p>The primary function of a Calibration Database is to provide an 
		average optical calibration factor (OCF), which is used to calculate the 
		number of target molecules within an <a href="experiment_database.html">Experiment Database</a>. Note that a calibration database can 
		only contain one <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Reaction_Setup">reaction 
		setup</a>, 
		so that a new calibration database must be created for each type of 
		reaction setup.</p>

		<p>Similar to the <a href="experiment_database.html">Experiment Database</a>, data is stored in a tree-like 
		structure in which calibration profiles are listed under the 
		corresponding run. 
		An &quot;Average Calibration Profile&quot; is 
		derived by averaging of the profiles from each of their respective 
		replicate profiles to produce an
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile</a>. </p>
		<p>The primary function of a Calibration Database is to provide an 
		average optical calibration factor (OCF), which is used to calculate the 
		number of target molecules from a sample within the
		<a href="experiment_database.html">Experiment Database</a>. The
		<a href="../optical_calibration/optical_calibration_overview.html">
		Optical Calibration</a> section provides details as to how an OCF is 
		generated and its function in correlating fluorescence units to DNA 
		mass. </p>

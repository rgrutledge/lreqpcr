        <h1>Version 0.5bet</h1>
		<p><b>Ver. 0.5b</b> is the first public release of the LRE Analyzer, 
		which is reasonably stable and is expected to be relatively bug free. It 
		provides basic functionality for large-scale importing, viewing, editing 
		and exporting of qPCR data. The core functionality is automated LRE 
		analysis with options to manually adjust the analysis, primarily through 
		adjustment of the LRE window. </p>
		<p>The program also provides optical calibration functionality that 
		allows absolute quantification to be conducted without the need to 
		construct standard curves. In addition to database storage of real-time 
		PCR data, a database dedicated to storage of amplicon information is 
		provided, 
		the capabilities of which could be expanded in a future version. </p>
		<p>A number of quality control capabilities are also provided, that for 
		example, allow the monitoring of basic parameters, such as amplification 
		efficiency within individual amplification reactions, in addition to 
		providing the 
		coefficient of variation across technical replicates, which is a primary 
		indicator of quantitative precision. </p>

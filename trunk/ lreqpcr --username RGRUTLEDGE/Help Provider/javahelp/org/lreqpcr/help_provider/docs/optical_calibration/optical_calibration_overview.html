        <h1 align="center">Optical Calibration Overview</h1>
		<p>One of the distinctive aspects of LRE quantification is that target 
		quantities are determined in fluorescence units (i.e. the
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_F0">average F<sub>0</sub></a>). 
		This provides&nbsp;the opportunity to apply an approach used by a 
		conventional fluorescence assay for quantifying DNA, in which sample 
		fluorescence is converted into DNA mass, based on the fluorescence 
		generated by a known quantity of a DNA standard, such as 
		lambda gDNA. Furthermore, if the sample is composed of a homogenous 
		mixture of DNA molecules, such as is the case for an amplicon within a 
		PCR reaction, the number of DNA molecules within the sample 
		can be determined if the size of the DNA molecule is known.</p>
		<p align="left">Absolute quantification can thus be achieved using the 
		process: </p>
		<p align="center">target fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub><font face="Times New Roman">) →</font> 
		DNA mass (M<sub>0</sub>) <font face="Times New Roman">→</font> # DNA molecules 
		(N<sub>0</sub>) </p>
		<p align="left">The first step is accomplished via optical calibration, 
		in which the fluorescence intensity of an assay is quantified by 
		amplification of a known quantity of lambda gDNA. This generates what is 
		called an optical calibration factor or OCF, which is expressed as 
		fluorescence units per nanogram of dsDNA:</p>
		<p align="center">

		<p align="left">Once an OCF has been determined, the average F<sub>0</sub> 
		derived from a sample profile can be converted in to DNA mass (M<sub>0</sub>):</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/mo_equation.gif" width="134" height="70"></p>
		<p align="left">Importantly, M<sub>0</sub> is equivalent to the mass of 
		the amplicon region within the target. The number of target molecules (N<sub>0</sub>) can 
		thus be determined by converting DNA mass to the number of DNA 
		molecules, based on the amplicon size (A<sub>S</sub>), the number of 
		base pairs per ng of dsDNA, and the strandedness of the target:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/no_equations.gif" width="456" height="187"></p>
		<p align="left">Note however, that this process assumes that 
		fluorescence accurately reflects amplicon DNA mass and is independent 
		amplicon size and GC content. Although extensive testing has shown that 
		SYBR Green I fulfills these requirements, other detection chemistries 
		may not.</p>
		<p align="left">Another important qualification is that the lambda gDNA 
		must be amplified using a setup identical to that used to amplify the 
		samples. This introduces the concept of the
		<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Reaction_Setup">reaction setup</a>, 
		which incorporates all the factors that the impact the optics of an 
		assay. An optical calibration factor is thus associated&nbsp; with a 
		specific reaction setup.</p>
		<p>As described in the <a href="../quality_control/quality_control.html">quality control</a> 
		section, optical 
		calibration also provides a number of quality control capabilities that 
		includes monitoring of run to run performance. The universal 
		nature of lambda gDNA also makes it amenable to developing 
		performance benchmarks that can provide a foundation for assessing 
		performance differences, for example, between different instruments or enzyme 
		formulations. </p>

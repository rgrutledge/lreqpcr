<h2><font face="Arial">Set up the well names and designate the calibration 
reactions</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">The first step is to use the well labels to provide the 
amplicon and sample name, with a comma to separate them:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/mxpVer55.jpg"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The amplicon name must be first and the amplicon name must 
be identical to that entered in to the amplicon database, in order for the 
amplicon size to be retrieved. </font><span style="font-family: Arial">If a 
comma is not present, the program sets the amplicon name to “none” and the 
amplicon size to zero.</span></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The next step is to identify which wells are calibrations 
reactions. This is done on the Plate Setup page by selecting the corresponding 
replicate/well and on the right hand side of the page change the &quot;Well type&quot; to 
&quot;Standard&quot;, type in the quantity of the lambda gDNA in picograms in the 
&quot;Standard quantity&quot;, and finally setting the &quot;Standard units&quot; to &quot;copies&quot;. In 
the example below, replicate 8 contained 100 pg of lambda genomic DNA. Ignore 
the &quot;Standard units:&quot; box. </font>&nbsp;
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/mxpVer2.gif"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Calibration profiles are stored in the 
Calibration database. </font></p>
<h2 align="left"><font face="Arial">Export w</font><font face="Arial">ell 
information</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Move to the Analysis-Results window and 
select the wells you want to export. If you want access to the replicate 
profiles, be sure that the replicate averaging is turned off.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Switch to the &quot;Text report&quot; view and select 
the Columns using the right hand side menu so that the following columns are 
present:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/mxpVer3.gif"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Note that the T<sub>m</sub> 
column is optional and that the presence of other types of columns will be 
ignored. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Export the Text Report into an Excel 
worksheet. This can be done by right clicking in the Text Report table and 
selecting &quot;Export Text Report to Excel&quot;. Alternatively, this can be done using 
the File menu.</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/Picture3.gif" width="454" height="280"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Open the File menu, select &quot;Save As&quot; and 
select &quot;xls&quot; as the file type. Name the file similar to the run name and save 
the file. The file name will be used to name the Run during data import.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Finally an empty worksheet must be inserted 
by selecting Insert-Worksheet on the menu. This worksheet will be used to import 
the Fc datasets. Note the this empty worksheet must be the first worksheet in 
the workbook and that the Report data must by the second worksheet. </font></p>
<h2 align="left"><font face="Arial">Import the F<sub>C</sub> datasets</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Move back to the Amplification Plots view in 
the MXP program. On the right hand side change the &quot;Fluorescence:&quot; selection to 
&quot;R (Multicomponent view)&quot;:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/mxpVer4.gif"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This removes the auto baseline subtraction, which is 
important because the MXP software will try to correct for baseline drift that 
can led to aberrancies. The LRE program will conduct its own baseline 
subtraction. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">Export the chart data to Excel-format1:</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/mxpVer6.gif" width="650" height="113"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Copy all of the cells (Ctrl A, Ctrl C), move 
back to the first workbook, select cell A1 in the empty worksheet and paste in 
the copied cells (Ctrl V). </font></p>
<h2 align="left"><font face="Arial">Enter the Run date</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Go to cell A1 and enter the run date. This 
can be done by typing in a short form, e.g. &quot;5sep10&quot; and pressing enter. This 
must be done, as Run date is used to sort data, and an error will occur if it is 
absent.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Finish by saving the file.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">To initiate Run import, go to the Import menu 
and select &quot;MXP500op Ver 3.4&quot;, which will open the file selection dialog. Select 
the Excel workbook file and press &quot;Open&quot;. </font></p>

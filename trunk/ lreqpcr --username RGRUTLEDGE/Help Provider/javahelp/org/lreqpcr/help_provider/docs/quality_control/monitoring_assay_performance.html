		<p>The LRE Analyzer provides two general methods for monitoring assay 
		performance. The first monitors run-to-run variance based on optical 
		calibration conducted over multiple runs. In the example presented below, calibration profiles 
		produced over nine runs generated an average OCF CV of Â±7.1%:</p>

		<p>Although amplification of a highly purified target such as lambda 
		gDNA would be expected to produce lower run-to-run variance than, for 
		example, of a cDNA target, the average OCF CV does provide a general 
		indicator of assay performance. </p>
		<p>The second method provides an assessment of intra-run variance, based 
		on the repeatability of replicate profiles (i.e. technical replicates). 
		This example shown below is taken from the same dataset presented above, 
		in which four replicate calibration reactions were conducted on each 
		run. The target quantities generated by each replicate set were then 
		averaged, along with generating a coefficient of variation (CV). The CVs from each 
		replicate set across all runs within the database is then 
		averaged and presented in the LRE Window Selection Parameters panel as 
		the &quot;Av Repl-Fo CV&quot;:</p>

		(CAL1)</b><br>

		<p>Unlike the average OCF CV, the average replicate CV provides an 
		estimate of the intra-run variance. The same analysis is conducted when 
		an experiment database is opened. As would be expected when comparing 
		multiple amplicons, replicate sample profiles generally produce a greater variance 
		than that produced by the CAL1 amplicon used for optical calibration:

		<p>While these analyses provide only a limited perspective into assay 
		performance, in practice these have been found to be generally 
		effective in assessing the general performance of an assay. </p>
		<p>Note also that these datasets were generated with the Applied 
		Biosystems 7500, which has been found to generate&nbsp;high read precision. The optical performance of other types of 
		instruments has been found to vary significantly. See the
		<a href="optical_precision_overview.html">optical precision overview</a>

        <h1 align="center">The &lt;10 Target Molecule Problem</h1>
		<p><b>Scattering of replicate profiles</b></p>
		<p>In contrast to most samples which produce replicate profiles that are 
		highly clustered, samples containing &lt;10 target molecules can produce 
		highly scattered replicate profiles:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/fus_undiluted.gif" width="394" height="516"></p>
		<p>This is an example of a low abundance transcription that produced 
		replicate profile scattered over a two cycle region, which is predicted 
		by LRE quantification to range from 1-6 molecules with an average of 
		4.0 molecules per <font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l. Although this 
		large range of predicted target quantities suggest that quantitative 
		accuracy has been compromised, Poisson distribution provides an 
		alternative explanation:</p>
		<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/poisson_distribution_graph.gif" width="532" height="372"></p>
		<p>This illustrates that at very low target quantities the frequency of 
		aliquots (Y-axis) that will contain a specific number of target 
		molecules (X-axis) can vary considerably, and that this variance is 
		dependent on the target concentration (Z-axis). Poisson distribution 
		further predicts that at target concentrations below about 0.5 molecules 
		per aliquot, the vast majority of aliquots will contain either one or 
		zero target molecules.</p>
		<p>The highly scattered FUS cDNA replicate profiles shown above are thus 
		consistent with that predicted by Poisson distribution. Diluting the 
		sample 10X (i.e. to a predicted 0.4 N/<font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l) 
		also produced replicate reactions that are consistent with that 
		predicted by Poisson distribution: </p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/fus_10Xdiluted.gif" width="390" height="445"></p>
		<p>Note that the four nil reactions are predicted to be a result of 0 N 
		aliquots, which in the absence of non-specific amplification products 
		will fail to produce an amplification product. Note also that 
		restoration of replicate profile clustering, along with LRE 
		quantification, indicate that this assay has maintained quantitative 
		accuracy down to a single target molecule. Note however, that to 
		accurately determine the actual target concentration the 0 N reactions 
		must be include in the average such that N<sub>av</sub> = 4/8 = 0.5 N/<font face="Times New Roman">µ</font>l, 
		which is close to the predicted 0.4 N/<font face="Times New Roman">µl.
		</font></p>
		<p>The &lt;10 molecule problem thus consists of two phenomenon that impact 
		LRE quantification. The first is that extensive scattering of amplification profiles 
		can dramatically compromise the ability to 
		generate an accurate&nbsp;<a href="../glossary/glossary.html#Average_Profile">average profile</a>. 
		The second is the necessity of averaging target quantities generated by 
		individual replicate profiles in order to accurately determine target quantity. 
		Importantly, as discussed above this must include zero molecule aliquots, characterized by 
		failure of an amplification reaction to generate a profile. </p>
		<p>When a target quantity of &lt;10 molecules is encountered, the LRE 
		Analyzer will report target quantity as an average of that derived from 
		the replicate profiles. This is indicated within the average profile 
		label by presenting the target quantity in brackets: </p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/below_10_molecules_labeling.gif" width="274" height="90"></p>
		<p align="left">Note also that during data export, samples with target 
		quantities below ten molecules are presented at the bottom of the 
		worksheet, and that target quantities are determined by averaging the 
		quantities derived from each of the replicate profiles. </p>
    	<p>The third LRE Overview video provided on the LRE qPCR website (<font color="#FF0000">sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr</font>) 
		provides a detail discussion of Poisson distribution and how absolute 
		quantification can be conducted based on the frequency of nil reactions. </p>

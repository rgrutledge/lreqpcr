        <h1 align="center">The Sorting Panel</h1>
		<p>The sorting panel provides two windows that allow profiles that to be 
		ordered by either amplicon or sample: </p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/sorting_panel.gif" width="304" height="128"></p>
		<p align="left">When either an experiment or calibration database window 
		is selected, these two windows become active. When either of these 
		windows are selected, a list is generated of all the amplicon and 
		samples, contained within the database: </p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amplicon_window.gif" width="290" height="191"></p>
		<p align="left">Note that the average Emax is presented in the label, 
		along with the standard deviation.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an amplicon, for 
		example, is selected, a list of all the profiles produced by this 
		amplicon is displayed within the experiment database window:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amplicon_window2.gif" width="284" height="66"></p>
		<p align="center"><b>Experiment Window<br>
		</b>
		<img border="0" src="images/amplicon_window3.gif" width="289" height="144"></p>
		<p align="left">In this case this amplicon produced 20 profiles 
		contained within this experiment database. Selection of any of these 
		profiles will trigger the profile editor window to display the profile. 
		Conversely, if a sample is selected in the sample sorting window, all of 
		the profiles generated by that sample will be displayed within the 
		explorer database window, and again selection of any of these profiles 
		will trigger the profile editor window to display the profile.</p>
		<p align="left">To return to viewing runs within the experiment database 
		window, click on the run view button:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/expt_run_view.gif" width="288" height="145"></p>
		<p align="left">Calibration profiles within the calibration database can 
		also be viewed in this fashion. That is, when the calibration database 
		window is selected, selecting on either the sorting windows will trigger 
		the calibration profiles contained within the calibration database to be 
		displayed as a list, similar to that for the sample profiles described 
		above.</p>
    	<p align="left">Note also that both of the sorting windows can be 
		&quot;slide&quot; into the right hand border by clicking on the
		<img border="0" src="images/slide_button.gif" width="22" height="18"> 
		button located on the top of the each window:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/slide_in1.gif" width="259" height="267"></p>
		<p align="left">This then allows the main window width to be reduced:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/slide_in2.gif" width="304" height="305"></p>
		<p align="left">The windows can then be opened by hovering the mouse 
		over the corresponding window button, which also allows the window to be 
		locked back into the sorting panel by clicking on the black circle 
		located at the top right of the window.</p>

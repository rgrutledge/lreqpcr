      	<p>Amplicon data import is provided within the &quot;Amplicon&quot; menu item:</p>

		<p>The import function uses an Excel workbook template. An empty 
		template can be generated by selecting &quot;Amplicon Import Template&quot;, which 
		will prompt for a file name and location. Excel should then open 
		automatically: </p>

		<p align="left">Note that only the name and size of the amplicon are 
		compulsory. Once the amplicon data has been entered and the file saved, 
		either create a new amplicon database file, or open a pre-existing 
		database, and select the &quot;Amplicon Import&quot; option. This will prompt for 
		selection of the amplicon Excel file, and the data imported into the 
		open amplicon database. </p>

        <h1 align="center">E<sub>max</sub> Normalization</h1>
      	<p>Particularly for Qiagen&#39;s QuantiTect enzyme formulation, LRE analysis 
		has been found to generate E<sub>max</sub> values &gt;100%, which are most 
		likely due to aberrant amplification kinetics that produce systematic 
		biases in E<sub>max</sub> determination (the source of these aberrancies 
		remains unknown). Depending on the amplicon, E<sub>max</sub> can reach 
		up to 107-110%, although most amplicons generate E<sub>max</sub> values 
		in the 100-104% range. Empirical testing has shown that a 1% 
		overestimation generates about a 10% underestimation of target quantity.</p>
		<p>Extensive testing has subsequently shown that normalizing to 100% is 
		effective in reducing, or in many cases eliminating, the quantitative 
		errors caused by this systematic bias. Thus, for profiles for which LRE 
		analysis produces an E<sub>max</sub> &gt;100%, the LRE Analyzer calculates target quantity 
		using an E<sub>max</sub> = 100%.</p>
		<p>A key component of this testing was to use &quot;limiting dilution assay&quot; 
		(LDA) to provide an independent determination of target quantity, which 
		has shown that normalization to 100% E<sub>max</sub> produces target 
		quantities within 15-30% of the actual quantity, even for amplicons that 
		generate E<sub>max</sub> values of 107-110%. As discussed in the
		<a href="../quantitative_accuracy/assessing_accuracy.html">verification 
		of quantitative accuracy</a> section, LDA is simple to conduct and does 
		not require a quantitative standard, thus providing a compelling 
		methodology for confirmation of the quantitative accuracy of any qPCR 
		assay, irrespective of how it is implemented. </p>

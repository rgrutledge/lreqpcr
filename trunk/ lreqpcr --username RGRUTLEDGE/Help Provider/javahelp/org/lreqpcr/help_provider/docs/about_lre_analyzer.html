		<p>Linear regression of efficiency (LRE) originated from frustration 
		with the limitations of conventional qPCR methods. One of the most 
		prominent (among many others) is that&nbsp;
		absolute quantification requires construction of standard-specific 
		standard curves<sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup>. This makes
		absolute quantification impractical for large-scale applications that 
		require quantification of more than a handful of targets.</p>
		<p>Founded on discovery that loss in amplification efficiency is 
		linearly coupled to amplicon DNA quantity, LRE was instrumental in 
		recognizing that real-time qPCR could be greatly simplified through the 
		application of sigmoidal mathematics. In combination with adopting 
		lambda gDNA as a universal quantitative standard, it became possible to 
		conduct absolute 
		quantification with few resources beyond that needed for target 
		amplification<sup><a href="#2.">2</a>,<a href="#3.">3</a>,<a href="#4.">4</a></sup>.</p>
		<p>Note that the LRE qPCR website (<font color="#FF0000">sites.google.com/site/lreqpcr</font>) 
		provides additional information about LRE, including a three part video 
		describing how LRE was conceived, along with a detailed overview of 
		methods that were used to evaluate the accuracy and dynamic range of 
		LRE quantification.</p>

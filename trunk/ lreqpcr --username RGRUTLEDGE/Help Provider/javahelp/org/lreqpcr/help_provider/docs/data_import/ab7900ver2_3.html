<p>Importing data from the 7900 is unfortunately one of the most complex. This is primarily due to the fact that the 7900 software exports 
data using a comma delimited file format, and that amplicon and sample 
information is exported as one file, whereas the Fc data sets are exported into 
a second.&nbsp; It is thus necessary to first convert the comma delimited files into an 
excel worksheet and then to combine the two datafiles into a single excel 
workbook.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Note that the amplicon name is taken from the &quot;detector&quot; designated to a 
well, so during plate setup be sure that the amplicon name is designated as the 
detector. Also, be sure that data has been &quot;Analyzed&quot;.</p>
<p>Go to &quot;Export...&quot; located on the File menu and select Results Table. Provide 
a location and name and push export:</p>

<p align="left">Use MS Excel to open the resulting text file, which will generate 
a panel asking 
about how to import the data. Simply push finish. Open this file, and save it as 
a .xls file using the “File-Save as...” in the File menu.</p>
<p align="left">Go to B5 and enter the run data.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fc data import</b></p>

<p align="left">Insert a new work sheet, which is where the Fc datasets will be 
located. Note that this must be the first worksheet in the workbook. </p>
<p align="left">Return the to 7900 Ver 2.3 program, go to the export panel and 
now selected the &quot;Clipped&quot; for export:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/ab7900_2.gif" width="713" height="396"></p>
<p align="left">Again select a location and name, go to MS Excel and open this 
new file as was done for the Results Table. Select and copy (ctrl A, ctrl C) all 
of the data in this new worksheet. </p>
<p align="left">Return to the first workbook and select A1 in the empty 
worksheet that was previously inserted, and paste the Fc data (ctrl V). Save the 
file, which is now ready to import.</p>

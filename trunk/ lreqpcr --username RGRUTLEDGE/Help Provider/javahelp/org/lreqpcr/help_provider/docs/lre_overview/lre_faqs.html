		<p><b>What is &quot;cycle efficiency&quot; and how does it differ from the classic 
		definition of amplification efficiency?</b></p>
		<p>Cycle efficiency, generally referred to as E<sub>C</sub>, defines amplification 
		efficiency as the increase in amplicon DNA quantity produced over a 
		single cycle, relative to the amount of amplicon DNA present at the 
		beginning of the cycle. For real-time PCR using SYBR Green I, the amount 
		of amplicon DNA present at the end of a cycle is reflected by the 
		fluorescence reading generated by that cycle (F<sub>C</sub>), whereas 
		the amount of amplicon DNA present at the beginning of the cycle is 
		reflected by the fluorescent reading at the end of the previous cycle 
		(F<sub>C-1</sub>). Cycle efficiency, which is normally expressed as a 
		percentage, is thus calculated by dividing the these two values:</p>

		<p>When applied to an entry amplification profile, a progressive loss in 
		cycle efficiency is revealed, </p>
		<p>and that this loss is linearly related to the quantity of amplicon 
		DNA. </p>
		<p><b>Why is there an extra cycle included in the Fo readings used to 
		calculate target quantity vs. the 
		cycles within the LRE Window?</b></p>
		<p>The LRE Window as defined by the LRE Plot, is based on the cycle 
		efficiency generated by the cycles within the LRE window, </p>

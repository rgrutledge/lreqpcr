      	<p>ROX normalization has been found to be highly unreliable, in large 
		part because its fluorescence intensity degrades throughout a run.&nbsp; 
		In addition, <a href="../fmax_normalize/fmax_normalization.htm">Fmax 
		normalization </a>corrects for well-to-well differences in fluorescence 
		intensity, making ROX normalization unnecessary. </p>

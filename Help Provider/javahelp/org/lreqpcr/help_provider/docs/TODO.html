        <h1 align="center">To Do</h1>
        <p>28Mar13: At this point, all that is needed before the next release is 
		to update the screenshots. Adding additional sections the primarily deal 
		with setting up and test a new assay could be considered, especially if 
		the sections related to new papers. However, it is unlikely that the 
		need to provided the next release will allow time for inclusion of these 
		sections. </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Update the screenshots</li>
			<li>The optical calibration section should start with a simple 
			protocol, with potential need to further simplify the description</li>
			<li>Generating an OCF section will have to include description of 
			Fmax normalization, which is still to be tested</li>
			<li>Data import needs to be reviewed</li>
			<li>StepONE data import needs to be prepared, although it appears 
			that it is identical to the 7500</li>
			<li>Data export overview will need to be updated to include Fmax 
			normalization and the new formats that have yet to be completed</li>
			<li>&lt;10N problem needs the profile list graphic to be updated</li>
			<li>Data export page is incomplete and will have to be revised 
			anyway, once the new export formats has been implemented.</li>

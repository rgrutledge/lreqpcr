		<p>One of the distinctive aspects of LRE qPCR are the quality control 
		capabilities it provides. Most of these were implemented during the 
		development and testing of the LRE Analyzer, and address such issues 
		such as monitoring assay performance and verification of quantitative accuracy, 
		in addition to revealing kinetic anomalies produced by 
		some enzyme formulations, amplicons and samples. </p>

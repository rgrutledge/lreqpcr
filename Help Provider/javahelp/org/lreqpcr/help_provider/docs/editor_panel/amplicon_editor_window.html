    	<p>Selecting the 
		<a href="../explorer_panel/amplicon_database_window.html">Amplicon 
		Database Window</a> will 
		trigger the Amplicon Edit Window to appear within the 
		<a href="editor_panel_overview.html">Editor Panel</a>:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/amp_editor.gif"></p>
		<p align="left">This panel allows editing of the information associated 
		with a selected amplicon. Note however, that a unique amplicon name, 
		along with the amplicon size must be provided, as these are required for 
		retrieving amplicon sizes during importing of profiles into both the 
		Experiment and Calibration databases. Note also that changes are 
		immediately saved to disk, and that there is no undo 
		function.</p>
		<p align="left">Additional details about the Amplicon Editor are 
		provided in the
		<a href="../explorer_panel/amplicon_database_window.html">Amplicon 
		Database Window</a> page.</p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Set up the well names and designate the calibration
reactions</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">The well label provides both the sample and amplicon
names, which must be separated by a comma. </font><span style="font-family: Arial">
If a comma is not present, the program sets the amplicon name to “none” and the
amplicon size to zero.</span></p>
<p>If calibration reactions are
present, set the “Task” for each of these wells to “Standard” and
enter the quantity of lambda DNA in picograms (this is generally 100 pg).
</p>
<p>In the well shown below,
&quot;actin&quot; is the amplicon and &quot;SR1&quot; is the sample. For illustration the well has
been designated as a &quot;standard&quot; containing 100 pg of lambda gDNA. Note
that calibration profiles are stored in the Calibration database. Note also if a
Calibration database is not open, the calibration profiles will not be imported. </p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Exporting well information</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</h2>
<p><font face="Arial">Export the well information using the
“File-Export-Results” function located in the File menu. This generates an Excel
.csv file. Open this file, and save it as a .xls file using the “File-Save
as...” in the File menu. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Manually enter the run date located in the B8 cell (this
is necessary because the exported date is incorrectly formatted). This can be
done by typing in a short form, e.g. &quot;5sep9&quot;, and pressing enter. An error will
occur if the Run date cannot be imported.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Insert an empty worksheet (Insert-Worksheet on the menu
bar). This worksheet will be used to import the Fc datasets. </font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial">Import the Fc datasets</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">Return to the SDS program and export the deltaRn located
under the &quot;File-Export-Delta Rn” in the File menu, and select OK to overwrite
the first .csv file.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Open this new .csv file. Copy all of the cells to
Clipboard (Ctrl A, Ctrl C). Move back to the first workbook, select cell A1 in
the empty worksheet and paste in the copied cells (Ctrl V). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This should have generated the Delta Rn in the first
worksheet and the well information in the second worksheet. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Finish by saving the file. The Excel file is now ready for data import.
</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial">To initiate Run import, go to the Import 
	menu and select &quot;AB 7500 Ver 1&quot;, which will open the file selection dialog. 
	Select the Excel workbook file and press &quot;Open&quot;. </font></p>
